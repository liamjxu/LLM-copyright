TITLE: BLACK HAWK DOWN
EXT. HIGH ABOVE MOGADISHU - DAY 2

The first rays of sunshine hit us -- and a BLACK HAWK
HELICOPTER thunders over the arid Somali landscape.

SUPER: SATURDAY - OCTOBER 2, 1993
INT. BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER - SAME 3

A handsome Ranger, SERGEANT MATT EVERSMANN, surveys the

A make-shift camp surrounding a bombed-out building on a
hilltop bustles with energy.

SUPER: RED CROSS FOOD DISTRIBUTION CENTER
EXT. MOGADISHU STREETS - CONT.

Several "Technicals", old Toyota trucks with heavy machine
gun bolted in back, ROAR through the village.

Starving residents swarm a five-ton Red Cross transport truck
loaded with food as the Black Hawk floats slowly past.

The scene turns chaotic: villagers shake the truck; Somali
soldiers beat them back with sticks; ten-pound sacks of wheat
spill onto the ground; hordes of stick-thin villagers struggle
to grab the sacks.

A Somali GUNMAN OPENS FIRE on the mob. Blood splatters as a
few get hit. Screams. Panic. People scatter.

INT. DURANT'S SUPER SIX FOUR BLACK HAWK - SAME 5

MATT EVERSMANN jolts from the sight of the bloodbath. Whips
inside to the other RANGERS in the Black Hawk's belly.

EVERSMANN
Oh shit, did you see that?
(into headset)
Chief, we got unarmed civilians
getting shot down here at nine
o'clock!

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Durant surveys the scene below, then calmly speaks into his
headset.

DURANT

I got it Matt, I don't think we can
touch this.

Heavily armed Militiamen train weapons on the populace. One
shouts into a megaphone:

MILITIA MAN
(in Somali, subtitled)
This food is the roperty of Mohammed
Farrah Aidid! Go back to your homes!

Durant's Black Hawk circles the village.

DURANT
Command, Super Six Four we got militia
shooting unarmed civilians down at
the food distribution center. Request
permission to engage.

MATTHEWS (V.O.)
Super Six Four, are you taking fire,

Somali Militia men flee into the crowd as Delta sniper SGT.
DAN BUSCH trains his AR-15 rifle on the gunmen below.

DURANT
Negative, Command.

MATTHEWS (V.O.)
U.N.'sS jurisdiction, Six Four. We
can't intervene. Return to base.
Over.

DURANT
(frustrated)
Roger. Six Four returning.

Durant continues the chopper away from the village.

ON _EVERSMANN - staring down at the carnage-strewn streets
below. He can't believe it.

as though he's firing a gun at it.

The market bustles with activity. Militia men stroll the
streets, automatic rifles strapped across their backs.

HOOT slinks through the crowd, following a Somali DRIVER.
INT. MOGADISHU MARKET - CONTINUOUS 8

OSMAN ATTO, a wealthy Somali businessman, reads a USA Today
as he eats. The driver approaches.

DRIVER
(subtitled)
Ready, Mr. Atto.
EXT. MOGADISHU MARKET - MOMENTS LATER 9

The driver leads Atto to the waiting car. Hoot watches, speaks
into a microphone in his collar.

HOOT
Leaving.

Atto gets in his car and leaves.

Atto's caravan speeds through the dusty streets.

Several Black Hawk Helicopters track the caravan out of town.
INT. ATTO'S CAR 12
Atto smokes a cigar in the back seat, talks on his cell phone.
A Black Hawk Helicopter appears out the truck's window, flying
beside them.

DRIVER

Sir!

Atto looks out the window at the Black Hawk.

ATTO

(subtitled)
Keep driving.

CONTINUED: 12

A Ranger fires at_the hood of Atto's car, spraying oil all
over the windshield.

An MH-6 Little Bird, a transport chopper with two outside
benches, lands in front of the caravan, forcing them to stop.
Rangers surround Atto's vehicle and tap on the glass.

ATTO
(calmly into phone,
subtitled)
I'm going to be late. Call you back.
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM 13

Silence. The room is dark, except for the dusty yellow streaks
cast from the window.

Atto sits at a.table as GENERAL GARRISON enters and sets a

cup opposite him. Garrison wears khaki shorts and_T-shirt

and dons sunglasses in the poorly lit room. He's laconic.
eady.

Atto offers Garrison a cigar.

GARRISON
No, no thanks. I've got one.

ATTO
These are Cuban. Bolivar. Bellicoso.

Garrison holds up his own cigar.

GARRISON
(unimpressed, simply)
So's this.

ATTO
(laughs)
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba...

Garrison simply stares out the window. Atto lights his cigar,
regards it for a moment.

ATTO
I see not catching Aidid is becoming
a routine.

GARRISON

We weren't trying to catch Aidid, we
were trying to catch you.

ATTO
Me?
(laughs)
But am I that important? I hardly
think so.

(CONTINUED)
13 CONTINUED: 13

GARRISON
You're just a business man.

ATTO
Trying to make a living.

Garrison finally takes a seat opposite Atto.

GARRISON
Selling guns to Aidid's militia.

ATTO
(a beat, gravely)
You've been here what, six weeks?
Six weeks you are trying to catch
the General. You put up your wanted
posters. $25,000... what is this,
gunfight at the K.O. corral?

GARRISON
(laughs)
It's ah, it's the 0.K. Corral.

ATTO
Do you think bringing me in will
make him suddenly come to you? Make
him more agreeable? Hmm?

GARRISON
(simply)
You know where he sleeps. You pay
for his beds, much less his militia.
(the bottom line)
We're not leaving Somalia until we
find him. And we will find him.

ATTO

(immediately)
Don't make the mistake of thinking
because I grew up without running
water I'm simple, General. I do know
something about history. See all
this? It's simply shaping tomorrow --
a tomorrow without a lot of Arkansas
white-boy's ideas in it.

GARRISON

Well, I wouldn't know about that,
I'm from Texas.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2) 13

ATTO
Mr. Garrison, I think you shouldn't
have come here. This is civil war.
This is our war, not yours.

GARRISON
(finally rips off his
sunglasses)
300,000 dead and counting; That's_
not a war, Mr. Atto, that's genocide.
Now you enjoy that tea, you hear?

Garrison exits swiftly past two U.S. Marine guards.
INT. HELICOPTER HANGAR - CONTINUOUS 14
Garrison strides through the hangar, past helicopters.

GARRISON
How'd he strike you?

JOE CRIBBS, a tall, lean man a few years younger than
Garrison, falls into step beside the General.

CRIBBS
Urbane, sophisticated. Cruel.

GARRISON
Yeah, he's a good catch.
(they stop)
It'll take some time, but Aidid'1l
feel the loss.

CRIBBS
I'm not sure time is something we've
got in great supply.

GARRISON
This isn't Iraq, you know. It's more
complicated than that.

Garrison starts away. Cribbs trails him.

CRIBBS
Boss, most of Washington might
disagree. I'm just saying, they've
been calling for these dang situation
reports every morning this week.

GARRISON
(slips the sunglasses
back on)
Well, tell 'em the situation is ah,
fragile.

EXT. MOGADISHU AIPORT - DAY 15
SUPER: MOGADISHU AIRPORT U.S. ARMY HEADQUARTERS

INT. BLACK HAWK SUPER SIX ONE - DAY 16

Black Hawk pilot CLIFF "ELVIS" WOLCOTT addresses his Ranger
passengers as he prepares for take-off.

WOLCOTT
Well ladies and gentlemen, my name
is Cliff "Elvis" Wolcott. I'll be
your pilot this afternoon. Federal
regulations has designated this is a
non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.
For those of you enrolled in our
Mogadishu frequent flyer program,
you'll be earning a hundred free
credits this afternoon, and as always,
the air sickness bags are located in
the seat back in front of you.

BRILEY
Number one indications are good,
Cliff.

ELVIS
You got it.

BRILEY
Clear on two.

RANGER
And you're still clear at one.

The Black Hawk takes off into the blaring sun.

INTERCUT BETWEEN BLACK HAWK SUPER SIX ONE AND DURANT'S BLACK
HAWK as they skirt the coastline.

DURANT
Six One, this is Six Four. Go to UHF
secure. I've got some bad news.

WOLCOTT
Limo's a word Durant, I don't want
to hear about it.

DURANT

It is not a word, it's an abbreviation
of a word.

(CONTINUED)
16

CONTINUED: 16

WOLCOTT
Limo is a word in common usage. That
is the key phrase in Scrabble, my
good friend. Common usage.

DURANT
No! If it is not in the dictionary,
it doesn't count.

WOLCOTT
It doesn't have to be in the
dictionary!
DURANT
It does have to be in the dictionary!
WOLCOTT
They don't say limousine, they say
limo!
DURANT

Listen, when we get back to the base,
it's coming off the board.

Durant and Elvis rubber-neck as they pass each other, flying
opposite directions.

WOLCOTT
You touch my limo and I'1l spank
you, night stalker, you hear me?

DURANT
Yeah, promises.

OTHIC
That's a nice beach down there. How's
the water?

DURANT
Yeah, it's nice and warm. It's loaded
with sharks.
INT. OFFICE - DAY 17

BLACKBURN
Why not?
GRIMES

Didn't I just say "don't ask"?
(takes a drag off
cigarette)

Look kid, you look like you're about
twelve, so let me explain something
to you. I have a rare and mysterious
skill that precludes me from going
on missions.

BLACKBURN

BLACKBURN
(affirmatively)
Well I'm here to kick some ass.
EXT. DESERT COASTLINE - DAY 18

Hoot smokes a cigar on top of a sand dune as a Black Hawk
passes over him. We see that he is holding his mountain bike.

Wolcott lands the Black Hawk Super Six One on the beach,
kicks up a storm of sand. Hoot shoulders his bike, hustles
into the chopper.
INT. BLACK HAWK SUPER SIX ONE - SAME 19
HOOT
(over the ROAR of the
chopper blades)
Nice man, very smooth!
GORDON
(impressed with himself)
Single shot through the engine block!
HOOT
Shit, that's a shame man. That's a
nice jeep.

The Black Hawk lifts off and kicks up a cloud of sand as it
flies away.

EXT. BEACH FIRING RANGE - DAY 20
A line of Rangers fire M-16s at targets.
A military "Hummer" drives up to the range.

Behind the firing line, Eversmann blows a WHISTLE.

(CONTINUED)
12.
20 CONTINUED: 20

EVERSMANN
Cease fire, cease fire!

Check your weapons.

Grimes and Blackburn approach from the Hummer.

GRIMES
Sergeant Eversmann!
(as Eversmann turns)
Sarge.

BLACKBURN
Private First Class Blackburn.

EVERSMANN
(blankly)
Yeah?

BLACKBURN
Reporting for duty.

EVERSMANN
Not to me you're not. You're reporting
to Lieutenant Beales. He should be
around here somewhere.

GRIMES
Can I leave him with you?

Grimes just wants to leave. He's got things to do. Eversmann
smirks -- go head, go.

EVERSMANN
Yeah, go ahead.
(to Blackburn)
You brought your weapon?

BLACKBURN
Sergeant. Want me to shoot? I'm
rested.

EVERSMANN

When'd you get in?

BLACKBURN
Just now, Sergeant.

Blackburn looks so young and eager, and already sunburned
down one side of his face from the chopper ride.

21 EXT. HIGH ABOVE MARSHY WETLANDS - DAY 21

A herd of wild boars flees from the chopper.
13.

22 INT. SUPER SIX ONE - SAME 22
Upon sight of the boars Hoot cocks his rifle.

HOOT
Hey, who's hungry?

The other Rangers smirk.
23 EXT. MESS HALL - EVENING 23

Hoot stands before a wild boar on a rotating BBQ spit. Men
move along the chow line.

CAPTAIN STEELE, Ranger ground commander, steps up behind
Delta Sergeant SANDERSON in line.

STEELE
What is this, Sanderson? Another
taxpayer funded Delta safari?

SANDERSON
Not if General Garrison's asking.

STEELE
No, I'm asking.

SANDERSON
Have a nice meal, Captain.

IN THE LINE -- Hoot cuts in front of Blackburn, grabs food.

BLACKBURN
Hey man, there's a line.
HOOT
I know.
BLACKBURN
Well, this isn't the back of it.
HOOT
Man, I know.
STEELE

Sergeant, Sergeant?
Hoot turns to see Steel staring at him.

STEELE
What's going on here?

Sanderson watches them from down the chow line.

HOOT
Oh, just some aerial target practice
sir, didn't want to leave it behind.

STEELE
I'm talking about your weapon. Delta
or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.
You know better than that. You're
patety should be on at all times on
ase.

HOOT
(shows Steele his
finger)
Well this is my safety, sir.

Hoot walks off with his plate of food. Sanderson stops Steele
from going after Hoot.

SANDERSON
Let it go sir, the guy hasn't eaten
in a couple of days.

STEELE
You Dboys are a bunch of
undisciplined cowboys. Let me tell
you something, soldier. When we get
on the five yard line you re onna
need my Rangers. Ya'll better Learn
to be team players. It's rough out
ere.

Sanderson walks away as LT. COLONEL MCKNIGHT watches from
his table.

INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT 24

The barracks is divided by the arrangement of the cots.
Rangers here, Delta there, relaxing over Risk, Stratego,
cribbage, cards, Gameboys. Ping-pong games in the corner.
Pilots Durant and Wolcott are continuing their Scrabble game.

PILLA stands before a group of young men as though he's on
stage. He imitates Captain Steele, much to the amusement of
the men. Pilla tries to hide his thick "Joyzee" accent:

PILLA
Speak up!
(touches his forehead)
You say this is your safety? Well
this is my boot Son, and it will fit
up your ass with the proper amount
of force.

Off to the side Eversmann writes a letter.

(CONTINUED)
15.

RANGER (0.S.)
Is that a Jersey accent?

RANGER 2 (0.S.)
It's Georgia.

PILLA

(to another Ranger)
You'se guys, I'm trying to do this.
Give me a break.

(back in character)
Take those sunglasses off, Soldier.
Delta wants to wear Oakleys, that's
their business, I don't want to see
them on you again, hooah?

Other Rangers laughingly mock his "hooah."

PILLA
Hey, is that a hot weapon?

DELTA SECTION - Gordon plops in a seat opposite Shughart as
Shughart studies a critical move, finger on his bishop.

GORDON
Is that your move?

SHUGHART
My hand on the piece?

GORDON
I mate you in three whatever you do.

SHUGHART

I'd keep my eye on that queen before
counseling with others.

GORDON
Well she's just lying in wait.

NEARBY - WEX, the oldest Delta at 42, sketches on a pad.
Busch leans over to see: a medieval knight dragging an
enormous sword through a dense forest. Beautiful and scary.

BUSCH
Wex. It's good. You're improving.
WEX
(Wex shrugs, it's
okay)
Ah.
BUSCH
If I may make a suggestion,
observation?

WEX

Mmm hmm?
BUSCH

It's a children's book, right?
WEX

Right.
BUSCH

They are not supposed to scare the
living shit out of children.

WEX
This is the part of the story where
our knight, our warrior is about to
slay the one-eyed dragon and that's
scary. Besides, my daughter loves
this stuff.

BUSCH
I thought you finished that last
week. Hmm?

WEX
You done? I had to get a visual.

Across the hangar, Pilla is still doing his impression of
Steele for the group.

PILLA
Hey, we are at the ten yard line
here men, you understand? Can you
count? One, two, ten. Okay? Where
are my running backs? Where are my
running backs?

The Rangers laugh and respond with emphatic "hooahs". Pilla
doesn't notice as Steele enters.

PILLA
Hey, I didn't see you in church on
Sunday soldier. Had something more
important to do? Not on Sunday you
don't. Not anymore. I will make you
believe. You understand?

Pilla turns and finds himself face-to-face with Steele
himself. Goes ashen. Other Rangers watch to see what happens
next. Steele, surprisingly, smiles good-naturedly.
STEELE
That's pretty funny, hooah?

(CONTINUED)
24

17.
CONTINUED: (3) 24

The Rangers respond with a slight "hooah".

STEELE
See, it's a good impression. I
recognize myself. All right, carry
on.

Even though Steele seems to be taking it well, Pilla isn't
able to relax.

STEELE
A quick word, specials.

Pilla turns around and Steele grabs him in a headlock. The
Rangers laugh. Pilla flips the Rangers off behind his back.

PILLA
Yes, Sir?

STEELE
If I_ever see you undermine me again,
you'll be cleaning latrines with
your tongue until you can't taste
he difference between shit and french
fries. Is that clear?

PILLA
Hooah, sir.

STEELE
All right.

The Rangers applaud Pilla as he returns and plops on a couch
between two guys.

ANOTHER CORNER - KURTH, WADDELL, NELSON, and GOODALE talk
around Eversmann, who busies himself with his letter. LT.
BEALES is reading a book on Somalia.

LT. BEALES
Listen to this, if one skinny kills
another skinny, his clan owes the
dead guy's clan a hundred camels. A
hundred camels.

Waddell looks up from his book.

WADDELL
Camels. I wouldn't pay one camel.

GOODALE
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.

wood)
Is that really true lieutenant?

GOODALE
Eversmann, you really like the
skinnies?

EVERSMANN

It's not that I like them or I don't
like them. I respect them.

Kurth leans back in his chair and deals the cards.

They wait

Kurth star

KURTH
See, what you guys fail to realize
is, Sergeant here is a bit of an
idealist. Believes in this mission
down to his very bones. Don't you,
Sergeant?

EVERSMANN
Look these people, they have no jobs,
no food, no education, no future. I
just figure that, you know, I mean,
we either, we have two things we can
do, we can either help, or we can
sit back and watch the country destroy
itself on CNN. Right?

KURTH
I don't know about you guys, but I
was trained to fight. Were you trained
to fight, Sergeant?

for an answer. Lt. Beales watches him with bemused
Eversmann chooses his words carefully.

EVERSMANN
Well, I think I was trained to make
a difference, Kurth.

Everyone cracks up, but no one as_hard as Beales. Beales is
literally falling off his chair. It takes a moment for the
others to realize he isn't laughing; he's choking on his
tongue, having a seizure.

A Ranger hurries to his side, waves the others back.

RANGER
No-no-no! Stay back, stay back!

Eversmann stands, moves closer for a better look. The Ranger
cradles Beales.

RANGER
John, John, it's okay. John, John,
John, it's okay.

EXT. MOSQUE - MOGADISHU - DAWN 25
A speaker high atop a mosque calls out a morning prayer.

SUPER
5:45 AM - SUNDAY, OCTOBER 3

EXT. BEACH - DAWN 26

A young Somali wearing a baseball cap backwards is on his
knees, praying on the deserted beach in front of the old
city. Then shoulders his rifle and gathers his things to go.

EXT. INFIRMARY - MORNING 27
Eversmann waits outside the tent as Steele approaches.

STEELE

Well, he'll be fine, but not in this
army He's out of the game. He's
epileptic, going home.

(walks past Eversmann,

turns back)
I'm putting you in charge of his
chalk.

(off Eversmann's
reaction)
You got a problem with that?

EVERSMANN
No, sir.

STEELE
Now it's a big responsibility. Your
men are going to look to you to make
the right decisions. Their lives
depend on it.

That's great. That makes Eversmann feel more anxious about
it.

STEELE
All right.

EVERSMANN
Rangers are the way, Sir.

STEELE
All the way. Good luck, son.

Steele walks away. Eversmann turns back to the Infirmary
tent, enters and waves to Beales, considering the enormity
of the duty he's just been given.

EXT. BAKARA MARKET - DAY 28

SUPER: HALWADIG ROAD - BAKARA MARKET AIDID'S MILITIA
STRONGHOLD

Cacophony of noise and voices. The crowded outdoor Bakara
Market is in the center of the city.

The young baseball cap wearing Somali (TYE-DIE) we saw praying
on the beach now stands before a merchant who wants to sell
him a machine gun, demonstrating by firing into the air. No
one even looks over.

"Tie-Dye" appears to be more interested in a group of
militiamen talking above the stall's belts of ammunition, up
on the balcony.

A door opens behind them and two of Aidid's Lieutenants
emerge. The armed militiamen get up and escort the pair past
Tie-Dye without a look or word of acknowledgement except the
last of them, who gives the subtlest of gestures - an almost
imperceptible nod.

GARRISON (V.0.)
A long-anticipated meeting of Aidid's
senior cabinet may take place today
at fifteen hundred hours.

INT. MESH TENT - DAY 29
Garrison briefs Delta, Black Hawk pilots, and four Ranger

chalk leaders, including Eversmann. McKnight, Steele, Cribbs,
Matthews and Harrell are in front, the rest behind.

GARRISON

And I say may, because we all know
by now, with the intel we get on the
street, nothing is certain. This is
actual intel, confirmed by three
sources. Two tier one personalities
may be present.

(points to two enlarged

photos)
Omar Salad, Aidid's top political
advisor; and Abdi Hassan Awale
interior minister. These are the
guys we're after.

Delta let the photos burn into their retinas. Garrison looks
at Captain Steele.

GARRISON

Today we go. Same mission template
as before.

Garrison's hand moves past an overhead map of Mogadishu,
points to another map: the outline of a general "target
uilding." Two building entrances are marked "D" for Delta.
The men take notes as they listen.
GARRISON
15:45, Assault Force Delta will
infiltrate the target building and
seize all suspects within. Security
Force: Rangers. Four Ranger chalks
under the command of Captain Steele
will rope in at 15:46...
(points to four corners
on map)
...and hold a four-corner perimeter
around the target building. No one

Extraction Force: Lt. Colonel
McKnight's Humvee column will drive
into the city at 15:47
On Halwadig Road and hold just short
of the Olympic Hotel, here --
(points to the map)
Wait for the green light. Now once
Delta gives the word, McKnight's
column will move to the target
building and load the prisoners on
flatbed trucks. Immediately after
the prisoners are loaded, the four
Ranger Chalks will collapse back to
the target building, load up on
Humvees, and the entire ground force
will exfil the three miles back to
base. Mission time from incursion to
extraction: no longer than 30 minutes.

Garrison,

still standing before them, lets this sink in.

GARRISON
Now, I had requested light armor and
AC-130 Spectre Gunships, but
Washington, in all it's wisdom,
decide against this. Too high-
profile. Black Hawks and Little Birds
will provide the air cover with
miniguns and 275 rockets. Colonel
Harrell?

Garrison sits as he glances over at COLONEL HARRELL.

HARRELL
In_the C 2 Bird: Colonel Matthews
will coordinate the air mission, and
I will coordinate ground forces.
Colonel Matthews?

COLONEL MATTHEWS, early forties, speaks up.

MATTHEWS
Mission launch codeword is Irene.
Questions?

HOOT

Which building is it, sir?

GARRISON
Exactly which building we're
confirming right now. Somewhere around
the Bakara Market.

Garrison regards Hoot's reaction, then the others.

GARRISON
(primarily to Hoot)
I don't choose the time or place of
their meetings.

HOOT
I didn't say a word, Sir.

There is an unspoken unease in the room.

GARRISON
We're going into the hornet's nest
today. You give them time to react
and they'll swarm. Make no mistake.
Once you're in the Bakara Market,
you're in an entirely hostile
district. Don't underestimate their
capabilities.

GARRISON
Now we'll be going through friendly
neighborhoods before we hit the
market. So remember the "Rules of
Engagement": no one fires unless
fired upon. So let's go get this
thing done. Good luck, gentlemen.

EXT. TENT - MOMENTS LATER 30

The group files out. McKnight, the most obviously concerned
of them, lights a cigarette and slaps closed his Zippo
lighter. Eversmann watches from inside the tent as Colonels
Matthews and Harrell walk up to McKnight.

MATTHEWS
What's the matter, Danny, something
you don't like?

MCKNIGHT
(as if it's nothing)

No Spectre gunships, daylight instead
of night, late afternoon when they're
all fucked up on khat, only part of
the city Aidid can mount a serious
counter-attack on short notice, what's
not to like?

HARRELL
Life's imperfect.

MCKNIGHT
Yeah, for you two, circling above it
at 500 feet, it's imperfect. Down in
the street, it's unforgiving.

Eversmann continues to watch from inside the tent. He heard
it all.

EXT. MOGADISHU - DAY 31

SMITH

Yes sir, Sergeant Eversmann.
EVERSMANN

Smith runs off in to the hangar bouncing the basketball.
INT. BASE OFFICE - DAY 33
At a filing cabinet, Grimes carefully pushes the plunger
down on the coffee grounds in the coffee pot. He speaks over
his shoulder to the only other person in the cluttered office --
Sizemore.
GRIMES
It's all in the grind, Sizemore.

Can't be too fine, can't be too
coarse. This my friend is a science.

Turns, holding the coffee pot.

I mean - you're looking at the guy
that believed the commercials, you
know? About be all you can be. I
made coffee through Desert Storm. I
made coffee through Panama, while
everyone else got to fight, got to
be a Ranger.

As Grimes blathers, Sizemore reaches for a letter opener,
shoves it down his still-drying cast and scratches away.

GRIMES
Now it's Grimesy, black, one sugar.
Or Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?

Adds just the right amount of sugars. Grimes finally turns
and approaches Sizemore, sitting at a desk, trying to itch
under the still-wet cast. Hands Sizemore the mug.

GRIMES
What happened to you?

SIZEMORE
Ping-pong accident.

GRIMES
What?

SIZEMORE

So guess what? Your wish has been
granted. You're going out today.

GRIMES
You're fuckin' me.

SIZEMORE
You're taking my place assisting the
sixty gunner. Sergeant Eversmann
said to get your stuff and get ready.

Now Grimes is speechless. Sizemore relishes the moment.

SIZEMORE
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

GRIMES
(gripping his coffee)
Oh yeah. Hell, yeah.

Grimes is apoplectic. His eyes glaze over with a thousand-
yard stare. It's exactly what he wanted, but now that it's
come to him, he's not at all sure it's what he really wants.

INT. HANGAR - DAY 34

Delta and Rangers, in their respective areas, prepare in
their own ways, gathering equipment they think they'll need,
leaving behind what they don't.

Eversmann calls out to Grimes.

EVERSMANN
Grimsey! I want you to stick with
Waddell and give him ammo when he
needs it. Hooah?

GRIMES
(softly)
Hooah.

WADDELL
I wouldn't worry 'bout that. Generally
speaking, Somalis can't shoot for
snit.

GALENTINE
Don't worry about it. Just watch out
for the Sammies throwing the fucking
rocks and you'll be fine. Might even
e fun.

The other guys snicker at this.

KURTH
You boys do their thing now. What we
gotta do is cover them, choppers
gonna cover us. And we'll be all
right.

EVERSMANN
Look you guys, I know this is my
first time as ah, Chalk leader...
But ah, this is serious. We're
Rangers, not some sorry_ass J.R.0O.T.C.
We're elite. Let's act like it out
there. Hooah?

The guys all "hooah".
EVERSMANN
Any questions? We're gonna be okay.
All right, grab your gear. Let's
move out.
A few guys "hooah" again, disperse. Eversmann exhales heavily.

Grimes sets it back. Sees YUREK reach for a NOD - Night
Observation Device - and reaches for one himself.

TWOMBLY
Hey you're not going to need that
ei her, we're back before dark. You
might as well take dope and beer
instead.

Grimes just stares. Twombly, of course, is kidding.

GRIMES
What?

TWOMBLY
Ammo, dude. Take ammo.

Yurek puts the NODs back. Grimes sees Joyce removing the ~
rear panel of his Kevlar vest. Joyce notices Grimes watching.

JOYCE
Let me tell you something Grimes.
You've got about fifty pounds of
gear as it is, you don't need another
twelve. I_don't know about you but,
I'm not planning on getting shot in
the back running away.

GRIMES
Well I better keep mine in.

EVERSMANN
Hey, Grimes? The most impor tant thing?
Just remember when everybody else is
shooting, shoot in the same direction.
All right.

INTERCUT: Eversmann considers Blackburn, who appears more
fidgety than before.

As Joyce's putting on his armor, he watches Wex across the
hangar tearing off pieces of masking tape and writing
something on them with a Sharpie. Sticks them to his boots.

JOYCE

Ruiz holds the letter. Joyce gets up and walks past him.
Ruiz turns to a glum Sizemore.

RUIZ
It's a good thing you're right handed,
Adonis.
(mimes like he's
jacking off)
If not, I don't know what you'd do.

SIZEMORE
You're a funny guy, man.

Ruiz profers the letter to Sizemore.

in the head.

Suddenly the view swings straight up as he's hit in the head,

grenades.

Little Birds provide cover from the sky, wipe out a Somali
machine gunner, clearing the way for Eversmann's chalk.

chugs along behind the Delta to keep up as -- He hears a
loud FWOOOSH!, turns to see -- AN RPG, streaking right at
him. Grimes DUCKS behind a low wall as it ricochets and --
BA-WHOOM! -- hits right above his head.

Sanderson stops firing, looks back at Grimes who appears

EVERSMANN
No! Don't go!
Galentine can't hear or can't understand and hurries out. To
cover him, Eversmann has to step into the street, firing at
the edge of the building.

They continue moving. Then a Technical comes up behind them,
bullets flying.

Galentine looks at his hand, covered with blood. His thumb
is hanging by a thread of skin.

Pokes his head out to check the Street. Looks both ways as --
A SOMALI GUNMAN fires at him from one direction as -- The
Somali's TEN YEAR OLD son, AK-47 too big for his little hands,
FIRES from the other direction, poorly aimed bullets
ricocheting off the crumbling alley wall, just missing Yurek,
a bullet taking the heel of his boot off.

Yurek pulls his head back just in time as -- The SOMALI MAN
groans, hit by ricochet of his son's bullets. The man crumples
to the dirt, dying.

Yurek sees the kid run past him to his father, on his knees
over his father, wailing, AK-47 forgotten. Yurek holds his
gun on dying father and son. About to fire. Doesn't. Then
runs.

windows, doorways, rooftops. Othic near y steps on a hand in
the street, doesn't know whose it is. He'll figure it out
later; puts it in his pocket.

RANGER
Fire your weapon, Othic!

McKnight comes upon the writhing Wex. The Delta Operator has
no lower half of his body.

Wex is muttering something, somehow still alive, reaching up
at McKnight, taking his hand and squeezing.

WEX
Tell my girls they'll be okay.

McKnight watches him die. Then yells out.

MCKNIGHT
Othic!
Othic runs low -- to McKnight's side.
MCKNIGHT

Othic and a medic carry Wex, put him inside the Humvee..

Joyce returns fire. Then takes a shot in the back where he
removed the vest panel. Crumples to the street.

Kowalewski and McKnight drag Joyce's limp body toward the

Somali gunmen around it.

But now, there is nothing but sporadic gunfire on the corner.
Nelson glances back down the block toward the target house.

NELSON
Hey, Twombles?

TWOMBLY
What?

Twombly stands and moves over to Nelson.

NELSON
Come here! The Humvees ain't coming

TWOMBLY

Okay, let's go to the crash site.

NELSON
Okay. Just don't fire that thing so

gunfire from a fourth floor window in a building around the
corner. They can't move forward down the street.
DOWN THE STREET - Sanderson and his Delta (and Grimes) are
pinned down, waiting to move. Sanderson shouts through the

Steele and his Rangers are still pinned down. Steele hovers
over Ruiz.

STEELE

A Ranger MEDIC crouches along the street, gunfire blasting
over his head. Starts working on Ruiz.

SANDERSON clicks off the radio. Gives Delta command by hand

As DELTA move in a crouch alongside a five foot high earthen
mound.

Bullets kick up plumes of dirt along the crest of the mound
above Delta's heads as --

SANDERSON pulls a grenade, yanks the pin and runs up the
earthen mound, hurls the grenade four stories into the open
window -- a perfect toss.

A MOMENT LATER -- the room explodes, shredded Somali bodies
hurtling outward. More bullets rain at them from every
direction:

Grimes runs along the earthen mound again. More bullets rip
past him as he runs.

Steele and his Rangers follow the Deltas.

wounded comrades through the doorway, while groups of others
carry seriously wounded men.

SANDERSON
Grab him! Move him! Move him out of

Steele whirls on SANDERSON, furious.

STEELE
What the fuck are you doing out there?

SANDERSON
Doing my job! Look, we gotta get to
that crash site! We gotta get on
that street and we gotta move! Now
you have got to keep up, Sir!

Steele says under his breath so the others won't hear:

STEELE
(livid)
We are combat ineffective. We've got
too many dang wounded to move.

SANDERSON
Then give me some of your shooters
and it at'll get us closer to the
ird!

Steele nods. His eyes travel around the room. His Rangers
are blood spattered, dazed, shell-shocked. Most are frankly
terrified. His gaze falls on Grimes.

STEELE
Grimes! You're with Chalk Four!

Grimes flinches.

GRIMES
Yes, Sir!

Steele speaks to his Rangers, but he's looking right at
Sanderson as he says:

Grimes a once over. Shakes his head. This is who he gets?
Finally he sighs, grabs his weapon.

SANDERSON
My guys, let's go!

STEELE
All right, let's cover him!

A look from SANDERSON is all Delta needs to let them know
they're moving out. They start filing back out into the
dangerous streets.

Grimes heads to the door, uncertain. With a last look back
at Steele, Grimes readies himself. Then he runs after Delta.

DOWN THE BLOCK - on a different corner, YUREK is pressed
against an alley wall, terrified, alone, eyes wide. Hears a
ghostly, disturbing sound, coming closer -- clop, clop, clop.

Yurek prepares himself, gun aimed. The same donkey comes
clattering into the alley, walks right up to the stunned
Yurek.

YUREK
Nice donkey.

Yurek pats its head as he takes a look out into the wide
intersection. Then he bolts -- RUNNING around a corner, down

Othic tries to climb into the Humvee as well as the men
gingerly load Kowalewski in to the back.

MCKNIGHT
Get back in that truck and drive.

OTHIC
I'm shot, Colonel.

MCKNIGHT
Everybody's shot. We need the

A voice crackles through the radio.

RADIO VOICE (V.0.)
C3 says to take Halwadig and take it
straight.

HARRELL
McKnight, we need you to turn around
and head back to Halwadig.

INTERCUT to McKnight - radios back --

MCKNIGHT
You're shitting me. We just came
through there. There's gotta be a
better way!

HARRELL
That's the info I'm getting from
JOC. You need to turn around and
head back.

McKnight looks at Maddox. Shakes his head.

MCKNIGHT
Roger that, roger that. I cannot
believe this shit.
(sighs)
Turn us around, Maddox.
MADDOX
They're trying to get us fucking
killed, aren't they, Sir?

MCKNIGHT
Just get it over with. Drive!

MADDOX
God damn!

MCKNIGHT
Just, just get us outta here, god
dammit! Drive!

Resigned, Maddox executes a K-turn. The column slowly turns
around.

Maddox hits the gas. They head right back into the fray.

Hell begins anew. HUNDREDS of rounds RAKE the vehicles,
punching holes through metal.

The windshield SHATTERS, spraying glass into Maddox's face.

(grabs the wheel)
Keep your foot on the gas!

A bullet PINGS into the doorframe next to McKnight, slices
into his neck. Blood sprays the dashboard.

MCKNIGHT
Fuck!

He presses a hand on his wound.

Maddox's face is a mass of blood, hands to his eyes. But he
keeps stepping on the pedal, McKnight steering, neck bleeding.

EXT. CRASH SITE - LATE AFTERNOON 199

Still strapped to his seat Durant sees the Black Hawk flying
overhead.

Hears Somali voices, yelling, coming closer. Tries to reach
back for his rifle, grunts in agony, back damaged. Can't get

to it. Sweating, reaching, swearing in pain as -- SOMALI
FACES appear in his windscreen, raise their AKs at him. Durant
raises one arm to protect himself as he fires -- the first

Somali gunmen's chest EXPLODES.

Gordon and Shughart land. GUNFIRE raging as they charge toward
the chopper.

DURANT - Somalis charge the Black Hawk. Durant fires away.
He sees Shughart and Gordon rounding the corner, boots
slapping earth. Appearing like angels. They fire at the
approaching Somalis. Shughart bangs on the Black Hawk.

SHUGHART
Friendlies!

Shughart checks Frank's pulse.

DURANT

God, it's good to see!
GORDON

Oh, it's good to see you. How bad?
DURANT

My leg's broken. My back feels kinda

weird.

GORDON
We gotta get you outta here, buddy.
I'm pulling him out. Cover!

Gordon gently lifts Durant from the chopper and he screams
in pain. Shughart covers.

SHUGHART
I'm gonna put you down.

They prop him against a wall.

GORDON
Cross, we're at the Six Four crash
sight, securing the perimeter. You
all right?

DURANT
Yeah, I'm good.

Shughart puts Durant's MP-5 in his hands.
GORDON
You're locked and loaded. If you see
anyone come around these corners --
you watch your back.
Shughart and Gordon run back to the crash site.

DURANT
Hey! Where's the rescue squad?

GORDON WHIRLS, SAYS:

SHUGHART
We're it!

Durant is left alone, cradling his MP-5.

Steele talks to Harrell on the radio.

STEELE

I would dearly like to know where in

EXT. STREETS - DAY 201

In the lead Humvee of the Lost Convoy, Maddox mops at his
bloodied face while McKnight, peering out the broken
windshield, drives, his neck a mess of blood...

McKnight finds himself in front of a familiar building --
the target building.

MCKNIGHT
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, Maddox,
stop!

INT. MCKNIGHT'S HUMVEE - CONT.
Maddox face is a bloody mess. He slams on the brakes.

MCKNIGHT

Son of a bitch! Romeo Six Four
we're right back where we started!
I'm running low on ammo. I got many
wounded, including me. Vehicles that
are barely running.

HARRELL (V.O.)

Okay, Danny, I need a no bcs.
assessment here. Can you get to the
crash site?

McKnight hears groans of the wounded in back, sounds of tire
rims grinding on the road, bullets smacking into metal.

MADDOX
Colonel, I can't see shit.

MCKNIGHT
Negative. With the amount of wounded
we have, we'd do more harm than good.
We need to come back to base, rearm
and regroup and then we can go back
out.

HARRELL

Galentine throws his radio headset down.

EVERSMANN

GALENTINE
They're sending 'em back. The convoy's
headed back to base camp.

Some of the other men hear it and look over to Eversmann.
What now? What does he suggest now?

WADDELL
Oh, now that makes sense, don't it?
We need to exfil the wounded now,
and get the hell outta here before
its too late!

SMITH
If Colonel McKnight went back to
base, then he had a damn good reason.
It changes nothing.

Right now, some of his men don't seem too convinced.

Smith, Galentine, Kurth, Goodale, Waddell and Doc Schmid.

MEN
(in unison)
Hooah!
EVERSMANN

Conserve your ammo. Only shoot at
what you can hit. Hooah?

His men stare out into the city, gripping weapons. Fear
turning to anger, confusion into focus.

EVERSMANN
The convoy's gonna come. We're gonna
get home.
204 EXT. DURANT'S CRASH SITE - DUSK 204

Delta snipers GORDON AND SHUGHART are sprawled out under the
ruined chopper tail, ammo magazines piled beside them.

THEY FIRE at endless targets. Countless AK-47 muzzle flashes
flare from every direction. A living nightmare.

GORDON
Loading.

Gordon slaps in an ammo mag, Shughart covering them.

GORDON'S POV - firing again, he hits EVERYTHING. Militia are
nailed in the head, chest, some targets 100 yeards away.

GORDON

Shughart throws Gordon the mag and he loads it.

SHUGHART

Shughart grabs a magazine.

SHUGHART

Gordon grabs a magazine. Pile of ammo getting smaller.
ON THE PILE OF MAGAZINES - Gordon reaches for the last one.

GORDON
Randy, last mag!

Crowd of Somalis now charging at them, making suicide runs.
Too many of them.

Gordon takes a bullet in the head.

SHUGHART
Gordy!

Shughart runs in to Gordon.

SHUGHART
Fuck!

EXT. DURANT'S CRASH SITE - DUSK 205
Durant is firing his MP-5 at dozens of Somalis. Every time

he fires they disappear behind walls. Shughart scrambles

back to Durant, gives him a CAR-15 rifle. The weapon is

covered in blood. Gordon's.

Shughart touches Durant's shoulder.

SHUGHART
Good luck.

Shughart again crawls under the chopper as -- SOMALIS peer

around the corner. Durant fires at them. Two more gunmen

poke their heads around. Durant fires again.

On the monitors, Garrison can see roadblocks going up in the
streets surrounding Wolcott's crash, boxing the Americans
in.

CRIBBS
They still don't know we've gone in.

GARRISON
Look. We have stirred up the hornet's
nest here. We're fighting the entire
city. I want every vehicle possible.
If it has four wheels and armor, get
it! Get everything.

Garrison and Cribbs consult a map of Mogadishu, hostile and
safe areas outlined in red and green.

GARRISON
Now once they've assembled, we need
to move our men out of the hostile
area and back to The Pakistani
stadium, the safe zone. Now let's

Cribbs leaves the room.
INT. DURANT'S BLACK HAWK - CONT.

SOUNDS OF a FRANTIC FUSILLADE echoes from the other side of
the chopper. Shughart's gun roaring. AK-47s firing back.

The SOMALIS charge toward Shughart. Fires a quick burst. The
Somalis fall dead as -- Shughart takes several bullets at
close range.

SOUNDS of the fusillade on the other side of the chopper
continue. Then...the shooting stops.

A strange dutty spotping. then hundreds of Somalis swarm
from either side of the helicopter.

EXT. DURANT'S CRASH SITE - CONT.
A SOMALI pops his head around the corner. Durant fires,

dropping him. Click! The weapon goes dry as Durant runs out

The crowd drags the wounded crew from the chopper, tearing
off clothes, boots.

Durant has time to do one last thing: pulls a snapshot of
his wife and infant child from his flight suit pocket.

Somalis finally see him in the corner. They descend upon
him.

A rifle butt slams into Durant's face, breaking his nose and
the orbital bone of his left eye. He's kicked, spit on,
uniform ripped at, crowd trying to pull him apart.

The photo of his family falls from his grasp. In a haze of
pain, he crawls after the snapshot. A boot stomps on his
hand, photo kicked away.

KRATAKRATAT! Gunfire erupts over the crowd's head. Everything
stops as MO'ALIM hops down from a technical skidding to a
halt, .50 caliber smoking.

A big Somali with him, FIRIMBI, shouts into a megaphone;
FIRIMBI
(in Somali, subtitled)

Back up! Mohamed Farrah Aidid claims

this prisoner alive.
Durant opens his eyes, sees Mo'Alim's elaborate tattoos, his
teeth stained orange and black from khat. As Firimbi again
shouts into the megaphone, Mo'Alim fires his AK-47 over the
crowd's head. Somalis retreat as Durant passes out again.
EXT. BASE - DUSK 208
McKnight's convoy arrives, battered and bloody.

McKnight watches his men, many of them injured themselves,

Green light, Kilo One. Green light.

HOOT
Stop the vehicle. Let me out.

Struecker slows. Hoot jumps out. Raps on the side of the

Humvee for a couple of other Delta to join him, including.
Sizemore. The four run down a side street.

217 EXT. DOWN THE BLOCK - SUNSET 217

Twombly, Nelson and Yurek are sixty yards and across the |

Nelson nods, but Twombly isn't really sure he understands.

TWOMBLY
Now you're not just gonna run to
Eversmann's position, you're going
to stop. You're gonna turn around
and you are gonna cover me. It's
important you understand that.

Nelson nods again, but it's even less convincing this time.
Twombly glances to Yurek.

Nelson can't hear him. Twombly shrugs, Oh, fuck it, go. Nelson

Twombly's run perfectly.

Eversmann sees Somali's aiming but it's too late to warn
Twombly, who charges across the courtyard.

EVERSMANN
Fuck!

WHUMP! a Somali bullet hits Twombly in the back, right on
the bandolier of SAW bullets wrapped around him. Three SAW
rounds explode, lighting Twombly up like a human firecracker.

SMITH charges into the swarm of Somali gunfire, out into the
street to get Twombly --

SMITH
Twombly!

EVERSMANN
Smith, no!

Smith yanks Twombly to his feet and pulls him along, almost
to Eversmann before -- bullets trace a path up the street, a
round SMACKING into Smith's thigh, blood spraying the street.
Smith goes down.

SMITH
Oh, God, I'm hit!

Rips Smith's pant leg, is spurted with arterial spray. Blinks
through it to get his kit open. Stuffs Curlex gauze into
Smith"s gaping wound.

SMITH
Oh, oh, what the fuck is that?

Eversmann presses it into the wound but it's like trying to
cover a fire hose with a mattress. Schmid shoves more Curlex

SCHMID
Now listen Jamie, I've gotta do
something, it's going to hurt. Okay?
I gotta cause you more pain, but I
have to do it to help you. All right?
You understand?

SMITH
Give me some morphine.

SCHMID
I can't. It'll lower your heart rate
too far. I'm sorry. Here Twombly,
why don't you take his hands there.

He's already hooked up to two IV bags, needles in both arms.

SCHMID
I need you to hold the wound open,
keep pressure on the top of the leg.
Yurek, you're gonna take the feet
and the flashlight. On my count. All
right, Jamie. All right man.

Schmid looks at Eversmann to ask, ready? Eversmann nods.

SCHMID
One, two, three.

Schmid pulls out the Curlex, releasing the blood flow, then
sticks both hands into the wound and probes for the artery.
Smith wails. Schmid probes around until --

SCHMID
Wait, wait, wait. Okay. I feel it. I
feel the pulse.

EVERSMANN
Yeah?

SCHMID
I got it, I got it, I got it, yeah,
I got it. I got it, I got it.

snap.
SCHMID
Fuck!
EVERSMANN
It's going back in, it's going back

SCHMID
Hold it! Fuck, okay get out, get

EVERSMANN
Okay.
SCHMID
Hold the wound.
EVERSMANN
Okay, okay, I'm holding.
SCHMID
Fuck!
SCHMID

Move your hand.

EVERSMANN
Yeah.

Schmid's hands disappear into the wound again.

Gets the clamp ready, but Schmid can't locate the artery, he
shaking his head in frustration.

EVERSMANN
What?

Smith_is passing out. Schmid has to give up the search before
he kills him. His bloody hands come out without the artery.
Angry at himself, he stuffs new Curlex into the wound. Smith's
eyes slit open as he weakly manages:

SMITH

Oh no, it's not a problem.

gunfire grows louder as they near Crash Site One.

A RUMBLE - and Hoot motions with hand signals. They creep

forward down the block, guns raised, NODs over their eyes.

They fire again -- and commandeer an RPG gun.

Mo'Alim looks around, as -- CRACK!CRACK! Two more militia -

drop to the ground. He sees Hoot load a mortar and fire it

Eversmann is watching Smith, pale white, eyes glazed.
HE SAYS QUIETLY TO EVERSMANN:

You don't have anything to be sorry
for. You saved Twombly. You did
perfect.

SMITH

You okay, Twombs?

womb ly has wandered over, stares down at Smith. Doesn't
know what to say. Eversmann looks from Twombly to Smith.

TWOMBLY
Yeah, I'm okay, Jamie.

Now the whole room is watching as Smith begins hyper -
ventilating a sickening wheezing sound echoing off the stone
walls. Smith's eyes start to dart around the room.

Schmid runs forward.

SCHMID
Oh shit! Hold the wound!

The Alamo house is silent, everyone watching as Schmid
administers CPR. Compresses Smith's chest again and again.

After a long time, Eversmann reaches out, stops Schmid.

Doc sits back, covered in blood. Stares down at Smith,
resigned.

EVERSMANN
Oh, God.

INT. EVERSMANN'S POSITION -- LATER 243
Slumped against a crumbling wall in the silent house,

Eversmann stares at Smith's body, covered by a tattered

blanket in the center of the room.

Hoot moves to the body, finds Smith's CAR-15 on the ground,
blood-spattered. Hoot picks it up, takes out the magazine.

EVERSMANN
What are you doing?

Hoot doesn't look up as he clicks the rounds out one by one.

HOOT
We need the ammo.

Eversmann watches the Delta soldier pick up the extra rounds.

Cause Sergeant, you can't control
who gets hit, or who doesn't. who
falls out of a chopper, or why. It

As Wood brings the Little Bird in low, there are suddenly
countless dots of light surrounding the entire perimeter of
the area, from the streets and rooftops ringing the court
yard -- all firing at him.

He sees THOUSANDS of glowing Somali bodies, ghostly,
innumerable on his infra -- red monitor.

ADJOINING ROOFTOPS - more than two-hundred beat signatures
of Somali bodies charge across rooftops, coming toward the
chalks in a great wave, leaping from roof to roof.

OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET - three hundred Somalis move to
get in position to fire down at the chalks. Somalis climb up
staircases, ladders, appearing on rooftops like angry insects.

Jesus Christ! Look at that.

Wood pilots a nimble Little Bird over the crash site. Sees
nothing but dark forms around buildings and a blur of wrecked
metal below as he shrieks past.

I'm doing it.

The woman RAISES A HANDGUN -- Kurth fires and she falls dead.
EXT. MOGADISHU STREETS - MORNING 280
The group runs down the street, bullets whizzing past.

The men charge down the block on wobbly legs, running through
the smoke. People line the streets, cheering them on.

They run into the safety of THE SOCCER STADIUM.

INT. OLYMPIC STADIUM 281

The entrance is in sight. Doctors are inside, white tables

and sheets and water and safety and food and shelter and -

Eversmann makes it. Hoot, Sanderson, Steele, and the others
charge in after him.

They stare at the makeshift medical tents that have been set
up. Watching a Medic directing the seriously wounded to one
area, dead to another -

as UN workers bring them glasses of water.

Nelson and Twombly embrace.

Eversmann staggers forward.

EXT. STADIUM - MORNING 282

BEHIND THEM - Colonel McKnight gets his neck wound looked
at.

MCKNIGHT
Ah, shit.

MEDIC
The bullet missed your jugular by
about three millimeters. Don't move!

MCKNIGHT
All right, all right. Hurry up, hurry
up!

BEHIND HIM - Grimes, covered in white dust, rests on a litter.
Sanderson walks over to him and hands him a cup.

GRIMES
Little short on coffee, but I got
you some tea. How you doing soldier?

RANGER
I can't feel a thing.

INT. THE MEDICAL WARD - OPERATING ROOM - DAY 283

Garrison, standing by the door, has come into the chaos that
is the medical tent, watching. Somebody shouts,"... mop..."
And we see doctors and medics working over a man, the man
bleeding profusely, the doctors and the medics literally
slipping in his blood on the floor... And Garrison seeing a
mop nearby takes it up, and doing his duty, mops the bloody
floor... And as Garrison mops the bloody floor the doctors
and the medics are trying to save his men's lives...

INT. THE MEDICAL WARD - LATER 284
Steele moves through the tent... men in various conditions...
none of it good... He comes to Ruiz. The medic shakes his
head no.

STEELE

Hey son, hey.
Ruiz opens his eyes.

RUIZ
Captain.

STEELE
Lorenzo? How're you doing?

RUIZ
I went in and out. Medic says I should
be okay in a couple of days.

STEELE
That's great news.
RUIZ
Are we going after them?
STEELE
You bet your ass we will. We gotta
regroup.
RUIZ

Don't go out there without me. Don't
go back out there without me. I can
still do my job.

Steele puts his hand on Ruiz' face.

STEELE
Now you get some rest now.

EXT. STADIUM - MORNING 285
Eversmann comes over to Hoot, who is picking through
supplies... resupplying himself. Hoot goes about his
business... taping grenade pins one after another after
another... Calmly, efficiently...

EVERSMANN

(incredibly)

You're going back in?

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: 285
HOOT
(nods, matter of fact)
There's still men out there... God
damn!

He stops resupplying and picks up a plate and eats.

HOOT
When I go home... and people ask me,
hey Hoot? Why do you do it man? Why?
You some kind of war junkie? I won't
say a god damned word. Why? Because
they won't understand... They won't
understand why we do it. They won't
understand, it's about the men next
to you... and that's it... that's
all it is.

Eversmann does know... and starts to resupply himself. Hoot
shakes his head no.

HOOT
Hey. Don't even think about it, all
right? I'm better on my own.

And fully resupplied Hoot simply starts off... Eversmann

watches Hoot walk away... And Hoot suddenly slows,
realizing... shouting back...
HOOT
(congratulations)

Hey! We started a whole new week...

it's Monday.
And as he moves off... just another soldier, one of the dog's
of war...
EXT. WOLCOTT'S BLACK HAWK - DAY 286

Kids play on the downed helicopter.

EVERSMANN (V.O.)
I was talking to Blackburn the other
day, and he asked me, "You know what
changed? Why are we going home?"
And I said, "Nothing..." But that's
not true, you know? I think
everything's changed. I know I've
changed...

INT. A STORAGE ROOM - LATE DAY 287
Fluorescent lights... too bright.. too constant... a cooler's
humming... it kicks off and then on again...and we see
EVERSMANN... And he's clean... just some nicks and cuts,
band-aid pieces over some small wounds... but there are other
wounds, the kind you can't see at first glance...a soldier
who's been in combat... a look in a young man's eyes... a
look that makes you stop and take a deeper look... into his
soul... and that's just what we do... looking at his face...
into his eyes...into the window of his soul... as he's talking
to someone... easy, conversational... nothing out of the
ordinary...

EVERSMANN

You know, a friend of mine asked me
before I got here, it was when we
were all shipping out. He asked me...
"why are you going to fight somebody
else's war? What do ya'll think
you're heros...?"

He laughs at the idea...

EVERSMANN
I didn't know what to say at the
time, but... if he asks me again...I'd

say...No. I'd say there's no way in
hell...nobody asks to be a hero...it
just sometimes turns out that way...

And for the first time we see he's been talking to a familiar
man, lying motionless on a stretcher...

And Eversmann, needing to make a final connection touches
Smith's chest... a hero's heart... another somebody who didn't
ask to be a hero..

EVERSMANN
(simply)
I'm gonna talk to your ma and pa
when I get home, okay?

And we see there are other men on stretchers, other young
men who left a piece of their hearts behind...

And he turns and leaves...the lights forever on...the cooler
humming... the boys going home men...

My love, you're strong and you'll do
