EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Eva, 45 and attractive, gets out of her old Prius, takes out
a large massage table and proceeds to carry it to the
apartment building. She’s wearing sweatpants and sneakers,
ready for work.

INT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT - DAY

A middle aged man, MARTIN, is enjoying his massage. Face up,
gaping mouth and utterly relaxed, Eva works on his neck and
shoulders from behind him.

MARTIN
Oh, yeah, right there, my neck. Perfect.
EVA
Take a deep breath and hold it a minute.
(he does)

Now, exhale.

He lets out a long exhale and Eva almost falls over from his
BAD BREATH. She has to back up.

EVA (CONT'D)
Good...

MARTIN
Should I do it again?

EVA
No, no. One is good.

INT. BRENTWOOD HOUSE/BEDROOM - DAY

Eva gives a massage to CYNTHIA, 35, who lies face down.
Despite the soothing music, Cynthia talks loudly and
constantly.

CYNTHIA
She brought cupcakes, I brought cake
pops, and she goes “they’re the same
thing” but they’re not the same thing
because a cupcake is a cupcake, a cake
pop is a cake with a stick in it. Anyway,
the real issue is her daughter because
she’s not very smart whereas my daughter
Anna...
ENOUGH SAID 2

cynthia rolls over, continuing to talk. When she’s on her
back Eva closes Cynthia's eyes.

EXT. YOUNG MAN'S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY
Eva lugs her large massage table up the stairs to an
apartment. It’s heavy and clumsy. The front door (at the top
of the stairs) opens up and HAL, 30, greets her.

HAL
Hey Eva. Come on up!

He smiles and watches her struggle up the stairs, not
helping.

EXT. EVA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A cute, well kept bungalow type place.

INT. EVA'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eva is at her mirror putting on lipstick. Her daughter ELLEN,
18 and cute, comes in returning a necklace to the dresser.

ELLEN
Hey mom. Where are you going?

EVA
To a party with Sarah and Will so they
don't have to be alone.
(beat)
You want to come?

ELLEN
Why?

EVA
Because you’re leaving soon and we should
hang out.

ELLEN
I’m good.

She heads back into her own room.
ENOUGH SAID 3

INT. WILL'S NEW PRIUS - NIGHT

Will (42) drives. His wife Sarah (40) sits beside him putting
on some makeup. Eva listens from the backseat as they explain
something to her.

WILL
We can never find anything.

SARAH
She puts things in the weirdest places.
Like, if I leave my bracelets on the
kitchen counter she’ll put them in a
drawer in the kitchen.

(to Will)
Why can’t you just do it?

WILL
I always do it. I fired the gardener.
It's not fair.

SARAH
(to Eva)
We want to fire her but he won’t do it.
(to Will)
It’s not hard for you. Why does it have
to be fair?

WILL
You should do it because it’s hard for
you.

SARAH
oh, please.

WILL
Come on Sarah, grow up. You can fire a
maid.

SARAH
Is that the definition of maturity? Being
able to fire your friggin’ maid?

EVA
(leaning forward, showing
her lipstick)
Sarah, does this color look good on me?

SARAH
You look good. Pretty.

WILL
That's nice. Nice look.
ENOUGH SAID

EXT. PALISADES HOUSE - NIGHT

Will, Sarah and Eva scan the large party and the beautiful
back yard.

EVA
So whose party is this?

WILL
Well, he’s a big book agent and she’s an
interior designer. They know everyone.

SARAH
Maybe there’s single men here. Oh shit, I
see a patient.

EVA
What are you going to do?
SARAH
I don’t know. Ignore her until I can’t.
EVA
Show me. Introduce me!
SARAH
No way.
EVA
You're a wet blanket. Oh, I see someone
from my gym.

Eva wanders off to say Hi to the gym woman, HILARY. She's
standing with another very attractive and stylish woman,
MARIANNE. Both are mid 40's.

HILARY
Eva - hi. This is Marianne. This is Eva.
Eva's a fabulous masseuse.

MARIANNE
Oh! Nice to meet you.

HILARY
Oh, will you guys excuse me for a sec?
I've got to find a bathroom.

She walks off leaving Marianne and Eva alone.

EVA
That was abrupt.
ENOUGH SAID

EVA (CONT'D)
Wow, I love what you’re wearing. Your
dress, and your shoes and your purse.

MARIANNE
Oh, thanks. Gee, I should bring you
everywhere. I love your outfit. So,
you're a masseuse. And you're good?

EVA
I am.

EVA (CONT'D)
What is it that you do?

MARIANNE

I'm a poet.
EVA

And I’m a dreamer.
MARIANNE

No. Really.
EVA

Oh. You - you're really a poet?
MARIANNE

I am.
EVA

And you make a living?
MARIANNE

I do!
EVA

You're a poet. Now I know it.
MARIANNE

Good one.
EVA

Feel free to steal it!

ANGLE ON
Will standing alone, drinking. Eva walks up.

EVA (CONT'D)
I think I just got a new client.
ENOUGH SAID 6

WILL
Where?

Eva points. They see Marianne being fawned over by a COUPLE
OF GUESTS.

WILL (CONT’D)
She looks clean.

EVA
She’s really nice. And funny. Great
taste.

WILL
And extremely attractive.

EVA
You think every woman at this party is
attractive.

WILL
Pretty much.

Eva looks around.

EVA
There is not one man here that I’m
attracted to.

Just then TWO MEN approach Will. One is JASON, 50.

JASON
Will, didn’t know you'd be here!

WILL
Hey Jason. This is my friend Eva.

JASON
Hi. This is Albert.

They all shake hands. ALBERT is 45 and has a bit of a belly.

EVA
Nice party, huh? Lots of white balls
hanging down.

WILL
Eva was just telling me that there’s not
one man at this party that she’s
attracted to.
ENOUGH SAID

EVA
Okay! I don’t know why you would make
that announcement?

ALBERT
Is that unusual?

EVA
No, not unusual at all. And no offense.

ALBERT
(Joking)

That's okay, I’m not attracted to anyone

here, either.

EVA
Okay. Good. Yeah, it’s kind of an ugly
crowd.

WILL

(making conversation)
Jason, you've got a kid in college now,

right?

JASON
Two.

ALBERT
I've got one leaving in the fall.

EVA
So do I.

ALBERT
It’s all I have.

EVA
Me too!

JASON

Oh come on, you guys. You want your kids
to go away! It’s healthy!

EVA
Shut up.

ALBERT
Yeah, shut up.

Albert looks at Eva, clearly charmed.
ENOUGH SAID

INT. PRIUS - NIGHT

Sarah and Will drive home from the party, Eva is in the

backseat.

WILL

Do all the guys get boners?
EVA

No.
SARAH

Haven't we been over this?
EVA

Yes.
WILL

Massages make me nervous. I spend the
whole time afraid I’m gonna get a boner.

SARAH
You are?

WILL
So, do they hit on you?

EVA
You know you're starting to depress me.
They don’t get boners and they don’t hit
on me.

WILL
So, who do you massage? It must be so
strange.

EVA
I've got a guy who’s got like a hundred
stairs to his house and he never helps me
with my massage table.

WILL
Did you ever ask him to?

EVA AND SARAH
I/She shouldn't have to!

She gets out of the car.

EVA
Bye guys. Love you.
ENOUGH SAID 9

EXT. EVA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Eva gets out of the car, walks up to the house and opens her
front door.

INT. ELLEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Ellen is asleep in her bed. Eva enters and stares at her
child for a long, long time.

It‘s unfathomable how much she loves this person.

EXT. THE JOURNEY SCHOOL - MORNING

Eva's car pulls into the parking lot. Ellen and Chloe get out
and immediately they trot off with THREE FRIENDS.

ELLEN
Bye mom!

EVA
(out the window)
Have a good day honey.

CHLOE
Bye Eva, thanks for the ride!

EVA
Oh, you're welcome Chloe.

Eva sees TWO OTHER GIRLS, MADDY and SAGE, dressed way too
sexy, drop trash on the ground.

EVA (CONT'D)
Hey. Maddy Price! You littered.

Maddy turns and dead pans to Eva.
MADDY
(in English accent)

Excuse me, what did you say?

EVA
Pick up your trash. You're not British.

Maddy picks up her trash.

MADDY
What a bitch.
ENOUGH SAID 10

As Eva drives away -

EXT. MARIANNE’S SANTA MONICA HOUSE - DAY

Eva carries her massage table up to this beautiful Spanish
house. It’s not big, but it’s special.

INT. MARIANNE'S HOUSE - DAY

Bringing the table into the house, Eva admires the beautiful
place. It’s eclectic, colorful, creative, personal, perfect.
Fresh flowers everywhere, amazing art. Marianne wears a
casual but chic outfit.

MARIANNE
Come on in. Would you mind removing your
shoes?
EVA
No problem.
MARIANNE
And your socks too?
EVA
Sure.
MARIANNE

Would you like some ice tea?

Eva takes off her shoes and socks as Marianne slips into the
kitchen. She then appears with a glass of iced tea.

EVA
Oh yeah, that sounds good. I’m so glad
you called. So many people take my card
just to be polite!

MARIANNE
Well, I’m not polite!

EVA
(looking around)
Wow, this is soooo pretty! Can I live
here?
(sipping ice tea)
And this tea is kind of fabulous!
ENOUGH SAID 11

INT. MARIANNE'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Eva is working on Marianne while she lies on her back.
Soothing music plays.

INT. MARIANNE'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Eva is putting her table back together while Marianne wears
casual clothes and sits on the couch. They’re mid
conversation.

MARIANNE
I'm dating this guy and he has no sense
of humor.

EVA
Could be a deal breaker.

MARIANNE
Right? I don’t know what to do because
he’s very sweet.

EVA
Sweet can be good. Find someone else to
tell you jokes.

MARIANNE
Are you married?

EVA
Divorced. For ten years.

MARIANNE
Are you guys still friends?

EVA
Not really. We share a daughter. Other
than that it’s hard to believe I ever had
a laugh with the guy, let alone create a
child.

MARIANNE
I know what you mean about your ex. We
have zero in common. I don’t know how I
ever had a real conversation with him.

EVA
Crazy, isn't it?
ENOUGH SAID 12

EXT. MARIANNE’S HOUSE - DAY

Eva is putting her massage table in her car while Marianne
clips herbs in her front yard.

MARIANNE
Ill call you really soon. This left
shoulder is still so tight.

EVA
You ought to ice it tonight. And drink
lots of water. Stay hydrated.

MARIANNE
I will. Thank you again. I’m so glad I
met you! Oh, want some chervil? I’m
drowning in it.

  

She hands her some herbs.

INT. EVA'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - DAY

Eva sits in her kitchen eating lunch, VIDEO CHATTING WITH
SARAH.

EVA
What the Hell is chervil? She said she
was drowning in it.

SARAH
An herb.

(in American accent)
An herb. How long have you known me?

EVA
I can’t understand a goddamned thing you
ever say.

EVA (CONT'D)

The furniture was gorgeous. I wanted
everything in there.

INT. SARAH'S OFFICE - DAY

Sarah sits at her desk (in her therapy office) VIDEO
CHATTING.

EVA
She has no cellulite.
ENOUGH SAID 13

SARAH
How can that be?

EVA
I don’t know! There’s nothing!

SARAH
Anyway, Will said that some guy you met
at the party wants your number! Jason’s
friend I think.

Eva smiles, in spite of herself.

EVA
But we both admitted we weren’t attracted
to each other.

(beat)
What should I do? He’s kind of fat.

SARAH
He is?

EVA
He's got this big belly.

SARAH
Oh, come on. You have nothing to lose.

EVA
No, but he does. Ha Ha Ha.

Sarah just stares at her. Suddenly Eva notices the little
light on the wall go on behind Sarah.

EVA (CONT'D)
Your patient just arrived.

(beat)
What if you never went out there. Would
they just - (motions to shoot herself)?
Oh, was that inappropriate?

EXT. TRAGICALLY HIP RESTAURANT - NIGHT

TWELVE PEOPLE wait for a table outside a nondescript, store-
front restaurant. Loud music blasts out onto the street from
inside. Albert and Eva stand in front with the others, making
conversation. Everyone around them is YOUNG.
ENOUGH SAID 14

ALBERT
I’m sorry about this. I swear I made a
dinner reservation.

EVA
Oh. That's okay.

(beat)
What about you? What do you do?

ALBERT
I work at The American Library of
Cultural History.

EVA
The what?

ALBERT
Exactly. It’s basically a television
library.

EVA
(concerned)
You watch a lot of TV.

ALBERT
(smiles)

No, no. Television history. What’s on

now? I have no clue. I tried to watch a

Housewives of Idiot Town and I wanted to

jump off a building.

EVA
I watched one of those shows with my
daughter once and I couldn’t believe it.
They had no brains. And they all had fake
cheekbones. And fake boobs.
(beat)
You like fake boobs?

ALBERT
I like real boobs.

EVA
I got real boobs.

ALBERT
(awkward pause)
Well, that’s working out for us then.
ENOUGH SAID 15

INT. TRAGICALLY HIP RESTAURANT - LATER

They’re mid meal and haven‘t run out of things to say. They
have to shout to be heard.

EVA

How long have you been divorced?
ALBERT

About four years.
EVA

And was it mutual?
ALBERT

(embarrassed)

Not really, no.

EVA
Uh uh.

(beat)
And can I get her number?

ALBERT
Of course.

EVA
Imagine the time it would save.

ALBERT
Sometimes I think we should all just wear
signs around our necks. Get it all out

there.

EVA
What would yours say?

ALBERT
I don’t know. I’m a slob? I have ear
hair?

EVA
You know there’s ways to get rid of ear
hair.

ALBERT

Fully aware. Taken care of.

EVA
A slob, huh?
ENOUGH SAID 16

ALBERT
Not the dirty, hoarder kind, just the
normal kind.

EVA
Does your daughter live with you?

ALBERT
Half the time.

EVA
Does she mind your normal kind of mess?

ALBERT

I’m not that bad. But both she and her
mother are very neat. They love that
store - Christ - the empty box store?

EVA
The Container Store?

ALBERT
A whole store that sells crap to put your
crap in so you can buy more crap.

EVA
I love that store. I love crap!

ALBERT
So did my ex wife. And she put it in very
flowery and overpriced boxes.

EVA
They sell those in some manly designs,
you know.

ALBERT
Manly designs?

EVA
Yeah, browns. Little cowboys.

ALBERT
Little cowboys? Well, if they did, my
wife would have bought them for me
because she tried very hard to
domesticate me.

EVA
Living with someone else is not easy.
Peoples habits.
ENOUGH SAID 17

ALBERT
Listen to this -

(beat)
I don’t like onions in my guacamole,
right? So I would take a chip and kind of
swirl it around until the onions were all
on one side and then I could eat it. It
drove her bananas.

EVA
Seems kind of harmless.

ALBERT
Completely. But by the end of our
marriage it made her gag.

EVA
Well, that’s not nice.

He notices her hands.

ALBERT
You have - um ~ lovely hands.

EVA
Oh. Thank you.

ALBERT
I would have thought - since you’re a
masseuse that you would have big, manly
hands but they’re actually very lovely.

EVA
(awkward)
You have nice hands too.

ALBERT
(embarrassed)
Thank you.

EVA
They‘re kind of like paddles.
(beat)
Did they just turn the music louder?

ALBERT
No, I think you just got older.

Eva flags down a WAITER.
EVA

Excuse me, could you turn the music down
a little bit? I’m old.
ENOUGH SAID 18

WAITER
No, I’m sorry.

EVA
Are you sorry that I’m old, or that you
won’t turn the music down?

WAITER
We can’t change the volume.

The waiter walks away.

EVA
He's nice.

ALBERT
I find I don’t like younger people.

EVA
(with her hand to her ear)
Eh?

ALBERT
I'm sorry. I picked the wrong
restaurant.

EVA
Oh I’m having a great time. The food is
delicious. I mean I can’t hear anything
you're saying.

 

ALBERT
That’s probably why you are having a
great time.

INT. MENCHIES YOGURT PLACE - NIGHT

Albert and Eva put toppings on their yogurts at the self
serve bar. Albert lifts a spoonful of something red.

ALBERT
What is this, tomatoes?

EVA
That's watermelon! There’s some croutons
next to it.

He chuckles and dumps some candy in his bowl.
ENOUGH SAID 19

EVA (CONT'D)
Doesn’t that sort of defeat the purpose?

ALBERT

What, it’s non fat yogurt. You can put a
little stuff on it...

She watches him dump more crap on and she smiles, amused.

He looks at a COUPLE OF WOMEN looking very serious as they
stand there tasting flavors out of little cups.

EVA
What? The people tasting?

ALBERT

You know, just put some in your bowl.
You're not buying a house!

EVA
It's free.
ALBERT
Yes, it’s free. They're happy!
EVA
(laughing)

They have to taste. There’s many

variations. Cake Batter, Red Velvet.
(reading a sign)

I have no idea what that is.

Albert pays for their cups and takes out a photo of his
daughter.

ALBERT
This is my daughter.

CLOSE UP ON A PHOTO OF A BEAUTIFUL 18 YEAR OLD GIRL.

EVA
Yowee. She’s gorgeous.

ALBERT
Looks like her mom, thank god.

Eva turns on her phone and shows him a picture of Ellen.

ALBERT (CONT’D)
She's beautiful.

(beat)
You got any money?
ENOUGH SAID zu

Flustered, Eva goes for her wallet.

ALBERT (CONT’D)
Just kidding.

She laughs, relieved, as Albert takes out a twenty.
INT. ALBERT’S AUDI - NIGHT
Albert pulls his car up to Eva‘s house.

EVA
Well, I had a really nice time.

ALBERT
Me, too.

Albert leans in for a kiss but Eva leans back.

EVA
I’m not sure.
ALBERT
Got it.
EVA
I mean, maybe.
ALBERT
I understand.
EVA
It's just that I’m not sure.
ALBERT
(playful)
It's okay. I’m not deaf.

(beat)
Maybe a little deaf.

She offers a hand and they shake.

EVA
I like your paddles.

She moves to get out.

ALBERT
I like your ass.

Flattered and embarrassed, Eva beams.
ENOUGH SAID a

EVA
Well, thank you.

Albert can’t believe he just said that as she gets out of the
car, waving.

INT. EVA'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

She drops her purse and flops down on the couch next to Ellen
and Chloe. They are in a discussion, flipping through
magazines and eating snacks.

ELLEN
How was it?

EVA
Nice!

CHLOE

But what if he immediately hooks up with
someone else? I/1l die.

ELLEN
So don't do it.

EVA
What?

ELLEN
Nothing.

CHLOE

I can't decide if I should sleep with
Chris or not. We're going to separate
colleges and I don’t want to do it if I'm
gonna regret it later.

EVA
You're a virgin, right?

ELLEN
Don’t answer that.

CHLOE
(at same time)
Yes.

EVA
You can’t live in fear of making a
mistake. If you want to do it, you should
do it.
ENOUGH SAID 22

ELLEN
Stay out of it.
EVA
She asked me!
ELLEN
She did?
EVA

Didn’t you Chloe?

Chloe shrugs, stuck in the middle.

INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY

Eva sits on a couch outside the dressing rooms, knitting a
blanket. The girls are in a dressing room together.

CHLOE (0.S.)
That looks so cute!

ELLEN (0.S.)
You think?

EVA
(shouting to them)
Show me! Come out!

ELLEN (0.S.)
I don’t like it. I’m gonna try this one.

EVA
Hey. I forgot to ask you. What happened
to Maddy Price? She was such a bitch the
other day.

CHLOE (0.S.)
She had a threesome with Sage Berger and
Brendan Weiss and now she thinks she’s
Taylor Momson.

ELLEN (0.S.)
Chloe! Don’t tell my mom that!

CHLOE (0.S.)
Your mom's cool.

ELLEN (0.S.)
No, she’s not.
ENOUGH SAID 23

EVA

She can tell me stuff. You never do!
(stunned)

They had a threesome?

ELLEN (0.S.)
Forget it mom!
EVA
What is happening?
(beat)
Have you guys done that?
ELLEN (0.S.)
Mom? Shut up.
CHLOE (0.S.)
That's such a pretty color. You look
good.
ELLEN (0.S.)

Really? I think I like it.

EVA
Show me!

They still ignore Eva.

EVA (CONT'D)
Hello? I’m the one buying it.

Ellen comes out and shows her.

EVA (CONT'D)
You look beautiful!

Chloe comes out wearing a tight short thing. Then her PRETTY
MOTHER DEBBIE comes out of her own dressing room some
distance away, wearing the same thing.

EVA (CONT'D)
(surprised)
Look at you guys.

CHLOE
No way.

DEBBIE
What?

CHLOE

We‘re not buying the same dress, mom.
ENOUGH SAID 24

DEBBIE
I won't wear it at the same time as you.

CHLOE
Come on. You look stupid.

DEBBIE
I think I look good.

CHLOE
You're so lumpy.

Debbie looks at Eva for support.

EVA

If I could wear that dress I would.
DEBBIE

Thank you.
CHLOE

You would not. Mom you look crazy.
Disgusted, Chloe heads back into the dressing room.

DEBBIE
You’re not the only attractive girl in
our family, Chloe.

CHLOE (0.S.)
Oh please!

(beat)
Why can’t you just dress like Ellen's
mom? She looks normal!

Debbie glances at Eva’s attire and rolls her eyes as she goes
into the dressing room. Eva sits there in JEANS, SNEAKERS,
BAGGY SWEATER. Knitting. Oh well.

EXT. MARIANNE’S PATIO - DAY

Eva is setting up her massage stuff as Marianne lies on her
back. She places a bolster under her knees.

EVA
(beat)

So, what happened with your not-funny

guy?
ENOUGH SAID 25

MARIANNE
Over. It’s fine. What about you? Do you
have a boyfriend?

EVA
I had a good first date over the weekend.

MARIANNE,
How nice. What’s he like?

EVA
(putting a pillow under
Marianne’s neck)
Funny, and very sweet. We never stopped
talking. It felt like we were old friends
already.

MARIANNE
In a good way? ‘Cause that can sort of
kill the chemistry.

EVA
No, it was good. Flirtatious. I wasn’t
sure if I wanted to kiss him though, but
I think I do. When I first met him he
didn’t seem attractive to me. He’s not
typically handsome. But now I think he’s
kind of sexy.

INT. EVA‘S CAR - DAY

Eva looks at Albert’s house as she drives up and parks.

EXT. ALBERT’S WESTWOOD HOUSE - DAY

A 1930's somewhat neglected one story house. The lawn is dead
and the paint is peeling. The curtains are drawn inside.

Holding a bottle of cheap champagne, Eva exits her car and
walks up to the house. After a beat, Albert comes to the door
wearing a sweatshirt and pajama bottoms.

EVA
Oh my god, did I get the day wrong?

ALBERT
No. Why?
ENOUGH SAID 26

EVA
You're wearing pajamas.
ALBERT
I’m not.
EVA
oh.
ALBERT

I just like to be comfortable. You know,
it’s brunch, it’s Sunday.

EVA
Oh, good!

INT. ALBERT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

It’s dark everywhere, all of the windows are shaded with
curtains or blinds. He takes the champagne.

ALBERT
Thank you for this. I’1l make mimosas.

Despite the dark, cave-like quality, it’s nice. Newish
furniture, lots of books, an enormous flat screen TV. There
are PHOTOS of TESS everywhere.

Eva picks up a Chanel purse sitting on the table.

EVA
You carry a purse?

ALBERT
That's my daughter's. Outrageously
expensive but it was her 18th birthday.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Bagels and coffee are ready and waiting on the counter.
Albert makes drinks.

EVA
Bagels! I love bread! So, tell me about
her - your daughter, I mean.

ALBERT
Well, she’s very sophisticated - as you
can tell from the pocketbook.
ENOUGH SAID 27

She's smart, lovely and funny ~ and she’s
moving to New York. Very far away. Going
to Parsons school of design. I’m very
proud of her.

EVA
I bet.

ALBERT
But part of me thinks I shouldn’t let her
go. You know? She’s 18 and this is a
great opportunity for her but what if
something happens to her while she’s in
New York. I’1l never be able to forgive
myself.

EVA

The whole going away to college thing. We
send them off? We don’t know where they
are all the time? And aside from that,
what’s my life going to look like when
she’s gone? Lonely and pointless!

(beat)
Do you know that she doesn’t even want
her father or me to take her there? She
wants to say good-bye at the airport.
Here. Not even fly with her.

ALBERT
That’s horrible.

EVA
Heartbreaking, that’s the word for it. I
guess we better develop hobbies.

ALBERT
Yeah. I guess so.

EVA
I suppose I already have one. I knit.
I'll just knit for the rest of my life.
That’s my plan. What about you?

ALBERT
That's funny, because I weave.

EVA
(taken aback)
Like baskets?

ALBERT
Yeah, I do it in the garage.
ENOUGH SAID 28

EVA
Really?

ALBERT
(beat)
No.

She cracks up.

ALBERT (CONT'D)
What would make you think that I would
weave?

EVA
I don’t know! I’m actually kind of glad
you don't weave.

ALBERT
Me, too.

Then she looks down at Albert’s crotch and quickly looks
away.

ALBERT (CONT‘D)
You know, I try to picture her not being
here. I don’t see her all the time

anyway, but it will completely different.

EVA
Look, I can see your penis.
ALBERT

What?
EVA

(looking away)
I saw your penis. Your pajama thing is
kind of open.

Albert instantly drops his hand to cover himself. He’s
mortified. After a minute, he jokes.

ALBERT
Whaddya think?

EVA
I think you’re very... healthy.

ALBERT
Thank you.

EVA
Go change your pants, okay?
ENOUGH SAID 29

ALBERT
Be right back.

EXT. ALBERT’S BACKYARD - A BIT LATER

Albert (in jeans) and Eva are drinking champagne. Albert sits
in an old chair and Eva is on the ground pulling up weeds.

EVA
So, what happened? I don’t mean the
details, just the general.

ALBERT

I don’t think she liked me very much. We
never had sex - not my choice, she just
had no interest in it whatsoever. I’m
pretty sure she cheated on me. That was
awful. So obviously she liked sex but
just not with me. She thought my job was
stupid. I didn’t understand her. We
parented very differently. Fought about
it, always.

(beat)
Why are you wrecking my back yard?

EVA
You have a lot of weeds.

ALBERT
I do? Where?

EVA
These are all weeds.

ALBERT
I thought all that was good.

He gets down on the grass and helps her.

EVA
(beat)

We never had sex either ~ not his choice.

We were pretty out of synch in that way.
(beat)

We were out of synch with Ellen too. A

lot of fighting over how to parent.
(looking over)

That’s all good grass you’re pulling up.

ALBERT
I'll put it back.
ENOUGH SAID 30

He tries to replant it. Eva kicks off her shoes and rubs one
of her blistered feet.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

(beat)
Got some kind of blister thing going
there?
EVA
I guess.
ALBERT
Yup.
EVA
You're grossed out.
ALBERT
No, no.
EVA

You are. You’re freaked by my feet.

ALBERT
I have a little problem with feet. I
think it has to do with my mother.

EVA
Oh, she had feet.

ALBERT
Let’s just say they were overly colorful,
like a rainbow. Yellow, blue ~ veins and
blisters...

She stares at him, then moves to put her shoe back on.

ALBERT (CONT'D)
You don’t have to do that.

EVA
I think I should.
(beat)
I've never even had a pedicure. I know
everyone has but I just never saw the
point, until this actual moment. Plus I’m
really ticklish.

ALBERT
Want me to get you a band-aid?

EVA
Please. And maybe a bag for my foot.
ENOUGH SAID BL

ALBERT
Stop it.

EVA
Make it two bags. Two bags for the old
bag!

ALBERT

I knew I shouldn't have told you!

He goes into the house and Eva examines her foot.

EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

Eva is putting a couple of band aids on her foot. They’re mid
conversation.

ALBERT
They’re naked, right?
EVA
Yeah.
ALBERT

Are you ever attracted to them?

EVA
(here we go)
No. Never.

ALBERT
Well, I’m sure they’re attracted to you.

EVA
I don’t know. They’re getting massaged.

ALBERT
They must hit on you all the time.

EVA
(lying)
Sometimes. Yeah.
(beat)
I'll give you a massage sometime, if you
like.

ALBERT
I would like that. I would definitely hit
on you.
ENOUGH SAID 32

EVA
I think that might be okay.

ALBERT
Really.
(beat)
Want to kiss?
They look at one another for a bit.

EVA
sure.

And they do.

INT. ALBERT’S BEDROOM - THAT DAY

Eva and Albert lie under the covers, having just had sex.
Albert's bedroom is very sparse and lacks night stands. All
of his stuff - books, tissues, clock ~ lays on the floor
beside the bed. Eva reaches down for a glass of water.

ALBERT
You didn’t actually open your eyes at any
point, did you?

EVA
No, no worries. I figured if I kept my
eyes closed you wouldn’t see me.

ALBERT
I saw you.

He pulls her to him.

EVA
I'm tired of being funny.

ALBERT
Me too.

They lie there for a minute not talking.

EVA
But you’re not funny.

He smiles.
ENOUGH SAID 33

INT. SARAH'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Sarah and Eva are pushing a heavy piece of furniture across
the room. They’re getting help from Sarah’s son BRANDON (8),
and her daughter GRACE, (6), as well.

SARAH
I’m so excited for you! He sounds great.
EVA
He kind of is.
(whispering)

We had such good sex.

SARAH
How fun! I can’t even imagine.

Sarah stands back and looks at the furniture’s new spot.

SARAH (CONT'D)
What do you think?

EVA
I liked it where it was. You’re going to
get a hernia.

SARAH
(to her kids)
You guys can be done.

Brandon and Grace walk into the other room.

SARAH (CONT'D)
No Cleveland Show.

BRANDON
(without turning around)
Please.
GRACE
Please.
SARAH
Okay.
EVA

Jeez, you really put your foot down.

SARAH
Too tired to be a good parent.

EVA
Maybe stop moving furniture around.
ENOUGH SAID 34

Sarah flops down on the couch, picking up a decorating
magazine.

Sarah's maid CATHY, 30 and Hispanic, walks by straightening
up.

EVA (CONT'D)
What’s she doing here?

SARAH
(talking quietly)
You have no idea. Will refused to fire
her so I let it go for a while hoping
she’d just get better, but she got worse.
She even seemed like she wanted to be
fired cuz she was doing such stupid
things.

EVA
Well, good.

SARAH
So I fired her and she started crying.
And then I started crying and then we
were hugging and then I hired her back.

EVA
You're nice.

SARAH
Right? Some people might think that I’m
compassionate or soft hearted or
whatever, but Will just thinks I’m a
baby. He wants me to fire her again as a
learning experience.

EVA
Jesus.

SARAH
That’s our relationship, right there.

EVA
Oh come on, it’s so much more than that.

SARAH
Whatever. He’s an jerk. He was a middle
child and never got enough fried chicken
at the dinner table and thinks everything
has to be fair.

Cathy appears.
ENOUGH SAID 35

CATHY
Mrs. Sarah. Where do you want me to put
this? It was in the bathroom.

She holds up a ping pong paddle.

SARAH
Outside? With the ping pong table.

CATHY
Okay, no problem.

She goes off and the two share a smile.

EXT. EVA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Albert's car is parked behind Eva’s in the driveway.

INT. EVA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Albert and Eva, only half awake, are sitting up in bed. Eva‘s
mouth is wide open and Albert is looking inside it.

ALBERT
I've never actually seen wisdom teeth. I
didn’t think anyone had them. You have a
lot of fillings.

EVA
Do they look like the mercury kind?
ALBERT
No. Just normal fillings and a couple of
crowns.
Eva closes her mouth.
EVA
Okay, your turn.
ALBERT
No.
EVA
Come on.
(seductive)

Open your mouth.
ENOUGH SAID 36

ALBERT
Make me.

She kisses him and he immediately opens up.

EVA
You're missing a tooth!
ALBERT
I am.
EVA

It's way back there. You can’t see it.

ALBERT
I've got to get some kind of hideous bone
graft and it costs a fortune and I’ve
been putting it off.

EVA

Yeah, my grandma Dee Dee had that.
ALBERT

Exactly. Grandma Dee Dee. Thank you for

that.
They kiss when suddenly they hear footsteps.

EVA
Huh?

Chloe is standing at the bedroom door.

CHLOE
Oh my god I’m so sorry.
EVA
Hi honey.
CHLOE
I didn’t know...
EVA
This is Chloe, Ellen’s best friend. This
is Albert.
ALBERT
Hi.
CHLOE

Ellen didn’t answer my texts so I thought
she was sleeping.
ENOUGH SAID 37

EVA
She's at her dad’s. You okay?
CHLOE
Yeah, I just wanted to go out to
breakfast.
EVA

(turning to Albert)
You hungry?

INT. KITCHEN - A BIT LATER
Albert, Eva and Chloe are eating breakfast.

CHLOE
So if I tell you a day and a year you'll
know what was on?

ALBERT
Shoot.

CHLOE

That's crazy! No way.
(beat)

1975, channel 4.

ALBERT
What time?

EVA
Oh, come on.

CHLOE
Saturday morning.

ALBERT
Woody Woodpecker, then Pink Panther then
McDuff The Talking Dog - I didn’t like it
but watched it anyway, Monster Squad -
Land of the Lost and then Big John,
Little John, which was like “Big” only
weirder.

CHLOE,
And I thought I watched a lot of TV.

ALBERT
I really looked forward to the line up.
ENOUGH SAID 38

EVA
What, were you rejected as a child?

ALBERT
Well, I was kind of raised like a veal. I
was put in a dark room and fed and told
not to move.

They crack up.

INT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT - DAY

Eva is giving the guy with bad breath, Martin, a massage. She
mouth breaths as he lies on his back, mouth gaping.

INT. BRENTWOOD HOUSE - DAY
The chatterbox is lying on her back as Eva works on her leg.

CYNTHIA
So I said ‘I guess that means you don’t
like it’ and she says ‘no, I just might
want another size’ but it was definitely
her size because she’s petite and big on
the top but the thing is I bought it at
Nordstrom Rack but I put it in a Neiman
Marcus box

 

EXT. YOUNG MAN'S HOUSE - DAY

At the house where the guy doesn’t help her - Eva is pulling
her massage table up the stairs.

EVA
(to herself)
That's right, don’t open the door.
Pretend you don’t know I’m here...
ENOUGH SAID 39

INT. AMERICAN LIBRARY OF CULTURAL HISTORY - DAY
They walk among the stacks of scripts and audio/video stuff.

ALBERT
We have the most comprehensive collection
of television shows from 1947 to the
present. I make sure things are
transferred properly, logged properly. I
write blurbs for them, try to make them
sound relevant and exciting in case
someone younger than fifty wants to put
down their phone and see something
original and brilliant.

EVA
Like what?

ALBERT
Like Jack Benny. Or Sid Caesar. Or Dinah
Shore. You wouldn’t believe the guests
she had on - Betty Grable, Frank Sinatra,
Ella Fitzgerald.

EVA
So cool.

ALBERT
It is. I kind of love it. And if it’s a
slow day I get to go downstairs watch a
couple episodes of ‘What’s Happening?’

She laughs and they have a kiss.

INT. HALLWAY - LATER
They approach an open office door.

ALBERT
This is my office. That’s Bob.

Bob looks up from his desk.

BOB
Hey.

EVA
Hey.

BOB

Hey.
ENOUGH SAID 40

INT. LIBRARY/VIEWING ROOM - DAY

They walk into the room where people are watching things of
video monitors. Eva admires some memorabilia that is placed
behind glass.

EVA
Oh, remember Flipper? I always wanted a
dolphin as a child.

ALBERT
That's a lot of work.

Suddenly they hear what sounds like a PERSON quietly crying.
EVA
(whispering)
What is that?
ALBERT
I think it’s somebody watching something.
It happens sometimes.

Albert Peeks around to see what THE CRYING GUY is looking at.

ALBERT (CONT'D)
Taxi.

EVA
Really?

ALBERT
It’s probably the one where Alex’s dog
died.

(beat)
You hungry?

EXT. THE BRICK HOUSE - LATER
Eva and Albert stand out front of a burger joint.

ALBERT
And here she is, right on time.

TESS, 18 and lovely, approaches from across the street.

TESS
Hi Dad!
ENOUGH SAID 41

ALBERT
(they hug)
Tess, this is Eva. Eva, Tess.

EVA
It’s so nice to meet you.

TESS
You, too!

ALBERT
So...

He gestures that they should enter the restaurant.

TESS
(disgusted)
Seriously.

ALBERT
They have great chili.

EVA
I love chili.

TESS
Have you ever been to Lily’s? It’s like,
around the corner.

ALBERT
(beat)
Lily’s it is.

INT. LILY'S - DAY

The three eat lunch in the upscale restaurant. Albert eats a
steak while Tess and Eva have salads.

TESS
I'll be studying fashion design.

EVA
Well, obviously you have great taste.

TESS
Thank you.

ALBERT
(to Tess)

Eva has a daughter just starting college

too.
ENOUGH SAID 42

EVA
She’s going to Sarah Lawrence. English
and History. She loves History. But I
think she wants to be a writer.

TESS
God, Sarah Lawrence is not what it used
to be.
(beat)

I mean, I'm sure it’s still good, it’s
just gone downhill a lot in the last few
years. Some of my - let’s just say - not
so smart friends ~ just got in. I was

shocked.
EVA

Uh huh.
ALBERT

I’m sure some very smart people go there.
TESS

I know. I’m just saying.
ALBERT

(joking)

And I’m just saying you should stay home
and go to school around here.

She glares at him.

TESS
At least you’re honest about it. Mom acts
like she’s so excited to be on her own
again but I don’t buy it.

ALBERT
Okay, let’s lighten up on Mom. She’s all
right. And don’t judge until you have
kids.

TESS
Except that I’m not having any.

ALBERT
(upset)
What? How can you know that?

TESS
I want a career. Anyway, I hate kids.

Eva looks at Albert, who looks destroyed.
ENOUGH SAID 43

ALBERT
Well, right about now we have that in
common!

EXT. LILY'S - DAY
They come out of the restaurant. Tess walks ahead.
EVA
(trying to comfort him)
She doesn’t know what she’s talking
about. She’s too young to know what she
wants.
Tess sees THREE FRIENDS coming down the street.

TESS
Cory! Hey you guys!

They all stop and chat. Each friend is chic and adult-
looking.

TESS (CONT'D)
(turning to Albert)
Dad, I’m going to get a coffee, okay?

She kisses him and shakes Eva's hand.

TESS (CONT'D)
So nice to meet you.

EVA
Yeah, you too!

ALBERT
Be careful.

Tess walks off.

ALBERT (CONT’D)
She has lots of friends.

EVA
Do you think they have threesomes?

ALBERT
What?! Why would you say that?

EVA
It's what the kids are doing these days.
ENOUGH SAID 44

ALBERT
Oh my god.

EVA
Right?
(contemplating)
I'm afraid that window has closed.

ALBERT
There was a window?

INT. EVA'S BEDROOM - MORNING
Ellen is climbing into Eva’s bed. They snuggle.

ELLEN
Hey. How was the daughter?

EVA
Kind of awful. A real snob.

ELLEN
That's too bad.

EVA
I wonder what your roommate’s gonna be
like. Want me to call her parents?

ELLEN
No.

EVA
You hungry?

ELLEN
Not really.

EVA
What did you eat yesterday?

ELLEN
I don’t know.

EVA
Think. Tell me everything you ate.

ELLEN
Cereal. A banana.

EVA
Where’d you get the banana?
ENOUGH SAID 45

ELLEN
(getting up)
You're crazy.

EVA
What did you have for lunch?

ELLEN
Bye!

EXT. MARIANNE’S BACKYARD - DAY

Eva is giving Marianne a massage on the patio.

EXT. MARIANNE’S BACKYARD - LATER
Post massage, they sit on lounge chairs and sip iced tea.

EVA
He's kind of flabby and middle aged but I
don’t care. I'm flabby and middle aged.

MARIANNE,
No.

EVA
It’s funny, our middle aged-ness is
comforting and sexy to me. Isn’t that so
incredibly sad? But sort of good, too?

MARIANNE
I think that’s what my ex always wanted
from me. To accept his belly and all of
his quirks. But in the end I was totally
repulsed by him sexually. He was kind of
terrible in bed. Very clumsy.

EVA
Oh no! That's awful!

MARIANNE
Oh, just a sec.

Marianne runs in the house and returns with her book of
poetry. She hands it to Eva.

MARIANNE (CONT’D)
It’s my last copy, but I want you to have
it.
ENOUGH SAID 46

EVA
(examining it)
Wow. You sure?

MARIANNE
Absolutely.

EVA
I'ma little intimidated, I’m not real
good with poetry.

MARIANNE
Just let them wash over you. Don’t try
and understand them.

EVA
Believe me, I won't.

MARIANNE
You know, I love being with you. Would it
be weird if we hung out, as friends?

EVA
I would love that.

MARIANNE
Me, too.
(beat)
Please, have some salsa. These tomatoes
are amazing.

Marianne pushes the bowl to Eva.

MARIANNE (CONT'D)
But watch out. I put in a ton of onions,
one of many upsides to my divorce.

EVA
What do you mean?

MARIANNE
My ex-husband hated onions so he'd take a
chip and swirl it around and around and
around until all the onions were on one
side -

Marianne shows her, scraping and swirling with disgusted
exaggeration.

MARIANNE (CONT’D)
It kind of made me sick.

Eva looks at her, alarmed.
ENOUGH SAID 47

TESS (0.S.)
Mom?

MARIANNE
(quietly to Eva)
My daughter’s not feeling well. I’11 be
right back.

Marianne gets up and Tess, in her pajamas, meets her in the
dining room.

Eva looks up and sees them talking quietly. IT’S TESS!
ALBERTS TESS!

Eva's stunned, freaked. She hides behind a bush. Marianne
brings Tess outside.

MARIANNE (CONT’D)
I want you to meet my friend. Eva!?
Weird, where'd she go?

TESS
I want to go back to bed.

Tess gives her little kiss.

MARIANNE
You have bad breath.

TESS
I'm sick!

Tess goes off. Eva comes out of the bushes.
EVA

I’m just admiring all of your plantings!
This one is so big!

MARIANNE
I wanted you to meet Tess...
EVA
Oh...
MARIANNE

Anyway, I better get going.

EVA
oh, sure.
ENOUGH SAID 48

EXT. MARIANNE’S HOUSE - DAY

Eva rushes out of Marianne’s house lugging her massage table.
Marianne stands at the front door.

MARIANNE
So, should we do something? Next week?

EVA
Absolutely. Yes!

Marianne gives her a long, affectionate hug.

INT. EVA'S PRIUS - DAY

Eva drives away from Marianne’s, her mind racing. She stops
at a stop sign, taking deep breaths.

INT. EVA'S KITCHEN - DAY
Eva is VIDEO CHATTING WITH SARAH.
EVA

Remember that new client of mine that I
think is perfect? Marianne?

INT. SARAH'S THERAPY OFFICE - SAME TIME
Sarah is at her desk.
EVA'S VOICE
It turns out she’s Albert's ex-wife! Can
you believe this? I am not shitting you.
SARAH
That’s an unbelievable coincidence. What
are you going to do?
The light behind Sarah’s desk goes on.
EVA
Damn it your light just went on. Call me
later?

They shut off.
ENOUGH SAID 49

INT. EVA'S KITCHEN - LATER
She makes dinner as Ellen and Chloe come in.

ELLEN
Hi Ma.

EVA
Did you take off your shoes?

ELLEN
No. Since when do I have to?

EVA
I want to start doing that. It’s cleaner.

Both Chloe and Ellen kick off their shoes.

EVA (CONT'D)
Socks too.

They roll their eyes.
EVA (CONT’D)

Listen to this. Turns out I’ve been
giving massages to Albert’s ex-wife.

ELLEN
How weird.

CHLOE
So weird.

EVA

I've been listening to this woman say the
worst things about the one guy that I’m
starting to really like. I pictured her
ex like this fat, irritating slob, and
it’s Albert.

(realizing)
Fat Albert.

ELLEN
Who?

EVA
Oh, it’s just a cartoon. A cartoon!

CHLOE
But he’s so not like that.

ELLEN
How do you know?
ENOUGH SAID 50

CHLOE
We all had breakfast the other day. He’s
really sweet and funny.

EVA
You liked him?

CHLOE
Totally.

ELLEN
What?

EVA

You weren’t home, honey, so we had
breakfast. That’s all.

ELLEN
But I haven't even met him.

EVA
You will.

ELLEN
What does this woman say about him?

EVA
Ugh. Terrible things. She thought he was
disgusting. A wimp with his daughter.
Useless in bed.

ELLEN
(gzossed out)
Mom!

EXT. PALISADES BLUFF - DAY

Eva, dressed for hiking, and Marianne dressed for
hiking/cocktails, walk up the hill. MANY OTHER WALKERS pass
them.

MARIANNE
I date sometimes, but it’s so hard to
meet people. I’m not attracted to
anybody.

EVA
And you weren’t attracted to your
husband? That must have been difficult.
ENOUGH SAID 51

MARIANNE
I tried really hard. He’d go on so many
diets and cheat all the time and act
shocked when he got fatter. It was so
irritating. It almost wasn’t the weight
that bugged me, it was his behavior about
the weight.

Just then TWO FEMALE HIKERS (30's), who are going in the
opposite direction, give Marianne a double-take.

FEMALE HIKER
Excuse me, are you Marianne Hope?

MARIANNE,
Yes.

FEMALE HIKER
Oh my god.

OTHER FEMALE HIKER
You are our idol. We were just talking
about you!

FEMALE HIKER
We admire you so much. I can’t believe
we‘re meeting you!

Marianne shakes both of their hands.

MARIANNE
Hello, so nice. Thank you so much.

FEMALE HIKER
You have no idea how much this means to
us. She gave me Beautiful Fruit when my
mom died and it literally saved me.

MARIANNE
How wonderful. I’m so sorry.
(ending it)
Blessings.

The hikers go down the hill, changed women. Marianne and Eva
continue hiking up.

EVA
Blessings!
(beat)

It’s so cool you saved her!

Marianne just smiles. Eva brings the conversation around.
ENOUGH SAID 52

EVA (CONT'D)
But he never got obese, right?

MARIANNE
It depends on your definition of obese.
EVA
Oh. Otherwise you liked him, more or
less?
MARIANNE

Unfortunately, less. He did so many
things that got on my nerves.

EVA
Like what?

MARIANNE
(beat)

I’m sorry I’m being so negative. But I

don't really have anyone else I can bitch

to about this kind of thing.

EVA
You can completely bitch to me.

MARIANNE
Thank you. I trust you.

EVA
(beat)
Oh good.

INT. SARAH'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Sarah’s living room has been partially rearranged. She’s
moving decorative pillows around, trying to find the right
spot. Eva helps her.

SARAH
What’s wrong with you? She can find
another masseuse.

EVA
I feel bad. She doesn’t have close
friends and I’m like, it.

(beat)
I feel so pulled in. She’s like a human
Trip Advisor.
ENOUGH SAID 53

SARAH
Albert's not a hotel.

EVA
No, but if you could avoid staying in a
bad one, wouldn't you?

SARAH
Oh my god.

EVA

She’s said so many bad things about him.
She knows what she’s talking about. She’s
very smart.

SARAH
So are you. And she’s not perfect.

EVA
But maybe she’s ultimately right.

SARAH

Are you ultimately right about Peter?
Just because you didn’t want him, does
that make him unlovable?

EVA
By anyone normal.

Sarah gives up.
SARAH
You didn’t say anything about my new
furniture arrangement.
EVA
(looking around)
I don’t remember how it was.

SARAH
Better or worse?

Will comes in the front door and looks around the room.

SARAH (CONT'D)
Do you like it?

WILL
Honey. Why do you keep doing this?

EVA
She’s filling a hole.
ENOUGH SAID 54

WILL
I’1l fill your hole.

SARAH
Different hole.

Will shrugs and walks away.

WILL
Missing out. Fun times...

EXT. EVA'S HOUSE - DAY

Eva comes outside and walks up to a FORD FIESTA parked at the
curb. She leans down to get in, seeing Albert in the driver's
seat.

EVA
Who's car is this?

ALBERT
Oh, Tess is getting hers fixed, so this
is a rental.

EVA
So why do you have it?
ALBERT
I'm letting her drive mine. She likes it

better.
Eva gets inside, tense.
EVA
(under her breath)
I bet she does.
INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

Eva and Albert are in their seats but the movie hasn’t
started yet. He’s shaking his large bucket of popcorn.

EVA
Why are you shaking that?

ALBERT
It spreads the butter around.

EVA
You put more butter on it?
ENOUGH SAID ery

ALBERT
Just the butter. I didn’t more butter.

Self conscious, he eats his popcorn.
INT. MOVIE THEATER ~ LATER
The movie is playing.
ALBERT
(talking about the movie)
I saw that actor once. He was about three
feet tall.

Eva shrugs, not wanting to talk.

ALBERT (CONT’D)
Do you like this movie?

Eva nods.
ALBERT (CONT’D)
What is she wearing? It looks like her
grandmother crocheted something and she
put it on her -

A GUY in another row shushes him.

EVA
You should whisper.

ALBERT
I am whispering.

Eva clenches her teeth and tries to watch the film.
EVA
That’s not a whisper.
INT. EVA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Albert and Eva have just finished making love.
ALBERT
I’m going to ask you something and I
really want you to be honest.
EVA

(worried)
Okay.
ENOUGH SAID 56

ALBERT

Can you breathe when I’m on top of you?
EVA

Of course.
ALBERT

I’m planning on losing some weight, by
the way. I know I need to.

EVA
(beat)

Oh?
(beat)

Was it ever an issue with your wife?

ALBERT
Sometimes I ate just to drive her nuts.

They lie there quietly for a bit. His breathing is loud.

EVA
You have a cold?

ALBERT
No. I broke my nose a couple of times. My
doctor says that at this point my nose is
purely ornamental.

EVA
(laughing)
You gonna get it fixed?

ALBERT
Yeah, right after my missing tooth.
(beat)
By the way, I think Tess really liked
you.

EVA
Yeah?

ALBERT
Yeah. I could tell.

EVA
(not liking Tess)
She seems neat.

ALBERT
I know she can be a little obnoxious, but
she’s figuring it all out. She’s got a
good heart.
ENOUGH SAID 57

He pulls her to him.

ALBERT (CONT’D)
I kind of adore you already.

INT. EVA'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Eva's toes, as Chloe carefully and slowly paints them a pale
blue. She tries to keep her feet still but it’s hard.

EVA
What happened with you and Chris?

Chloe blushes.

EVA (CONT'D)
What? You can tell me.

CHLOE,
We did it.

EVA
Oh my god, how was it?!

CHLOE
(beat)
Nice. I think. It was good.

EVA
Awww. Congratulations. I’m so glad it was
nice.

CHLOE
Even if we don’t stay together, I’m glad
I got it over with, you know? I’m really
glad I took your advice to -

Just then Ellen comes home and is surprised to see Chloe.

ELLEN

When did you get here?
EVA

A few minutes ago.

(beat)
I told her to wait.
ENOUGH SAID 58

ELLEN

I’ve been wanting to paint your toes for
ten years. I thought you were too
ticklish.

CHLOE,
She’s in love.

ELLEN
So that makes you not ticklish?

EVA
You weren't here. Sweetie. Be with us.

Ellen leaves. Eva and Chloe exchange an “oops” look.

EVA (CONT'D)
Ellen! Come back!

But there’s no response.

INT. MARIANNE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Marianne sits up, having just been massaged. Eva is
straightening up.

MARIANNE
Crazy morning. I got a wonderful call
from Joni Mitchell. She read the galleys
for my new collection and loved it.

EVA
You’re friends with Joni Mitchell?

MARIANNE
Yeah, we've been for a while. And I met a
nice guy, We went out last night. He’s in
great shape, he really takes care of
himself. He’s vegan. He actually read my
work before he knew me. Isn’t that cool?

EVA
A poetry reading vegan? Oh my god.

Marianne heads to the kitchen and keeps talking.

MARIANNE
We‘re going out again tomorrow. I hope it
goes well. I tend to get my hopes up too
early.

With Albert, it always felt like a bait
and switch.
ENOUGH SAID 59

When we first started dating, I thought,
‘He’s mature! He can buy a house?’

EVA
This house?

MARIANNE
Yes! And he cooked! He made me this dish,
spaghetti with eggplant and mozzarella.

EVA
That sounds delicious!

MARIANNE
But it turned out it was the only thing
he knew how to cook.

EVA
Uh huh.

MARIANNE,
And he has no friends. Neither do I -

EVA
Me and Joni.

MARIANNE,
That's true!

EXT. ALBERT’S HOUSE - EVENING

Eva knocks on Albert's door. He opens it and beams when he
sees her.

ALBERT
Hil

(beat)
Hungry?

INT. ALBERT’S KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - EVENING
Albert presents Eva with a plate of food.
ALBERT
I hope you like spaghetti with eggplant

and mozzarella!

He sets it before her and she looks sick. After a moment, she
eats.
ENOUGH SAID 60

ALBERT (CONT'D)
Is everything okay?

EVA
This is actually pretty damn amazing.

He sits with her.

ALBERT
How was work today?

EVA
It was good. I had two massages.

ALBERT
Tell me. Non stop talking? Barnacles?
Erections?

EVA
It was a nice woman in Santa Monica.
(beat)
She talks a lot about her ex husband.
Long pause. Eva is about to tell him the truth.

EVA (CONT'D)
Albert -

ALBERT
Let’s hope it wasn’t my ex wife!

She coughs, miserable. Stuck.
ALBERT (CONT'D)
(beat)

I have a little present for you.

EVA
You do?

She‘s nervous. He places a small box in front of her.

ALBERT
Now, it’s just a little present.

Eva opens the box and lifts up a pretty, simple necklace.

EVA
Oh my god.

ALBERT
I just saw it and thought of you.
ENOUGH SAID 61

He caresses her neck.

ALBERT (CONT’D)
This beautiful, wonderful part.

He gets up and puts it on her, kisses her. He can tell
something is wrong.

EVA
You like it on me? Thank you soooo much.

ALBERT
Maybe I shouldn’t have. Is it too soon?

EVA
No, it’s lovely. Thank you.

EXT/INT. ALBERT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eva and Albert are making love in the dark. He accidently
jabs her.

EVA
Ouch!

ALBERT
I’m so sorry.

EVA
No worries.

He does it again.

EVA (CONT'D)

Shit. Ouch.
ALBERT
What am I doing?
EVA
It’s just - your elbow - that’s better,
oh.
ALBERT
Good.
Eva giggles.
EVA

Your beard - it’s so ticklish.
ENOUGH SAID 62

ALBERT
oh, sorry.

EVA
That's okay.

They kiss some more. He climbs on top.

EVA (CONT'D)
! My hair!

 

ow! My hai
Albert stops and reaches for the light, which he flips on.
ALBERT
(upset)
Okay. I don’t know what I’m doing, but
this is not going well. Why don’t we just
stop.

He looks at her as she sighs deeply.

INT. ALBERT’S BATHROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Eva is standing in Albert's messy bathroom. She looks at his
grimy sink. He has about SIX toothbrushes in his cup.

She bends down to the cabinet and opens it. Cob webs, dust.

Ancient things. About FOUR bottles of mouthwash with varying
degrees left. She stares at them, disturbed.

INT. ALBERT’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eva comes out of the bathroom and sits on the bed.

ALBERT
You look cute in my robe. Everything all
right?

EVA

You have four hundred mouthwashes.

ALBERT
Uh, yeah. I buy them, I forget to use
them, I buy more...

EVA
Why do you have so many toothbrushes?
ENOUGH SAID 63

ALBERT
I don’t know. I only use one.
EVA
So why don’t you throw the others out?
ALBERT
(beat)

They're my friends?
Eva lies next to him and he snuggles in.

ALBERT (CONT’D)
Should we give it another shot?

EVA
Oh, I’m just so tired. Is that okay?

ALBERT
Yeah. It’s okay.

He goes to kiss her but she’s turning over, away from him.

INT. FAMILY ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

PETER AND FRAN (Eva’s ex and his new wife), Ellen, Chloe,
Sarah and Will. The food has not yet been served.

PETER
So proud of you, honey.

Everyone toasts to Ellen.

FRAN
We are. Here’s some graduation money.

She hands her an envelope.

ELLEN
Thanks so much you guys.

PETER
(joking)
It's in fives.

CHLOE
Thanks for including me tonight.

EVA
You had a fight with your mom?
ENOUGH SAID 64

CHLOE
Huge.

EVA
Where’s your dad?

CHLOE
He lives in San Diego but you'd think it
was across the Pacific. He never comes
up. I don’t care. He remarried a really
weird woman. She never talks.

SARAH
(maybe a little drunk)
Hear, hear for second marriages.

Will gives his wife a strange look.

FRAN
It's kind of true, though. It’s good when
everyone is a little older and wiser.

SARAH
Maybe second marriages work because
people have figured out how to
compromise.

EVA
Or behave, perhaps.

PETER
Thanks everyone!

EVA
No one is talking about you.

SARAH
Not you personally. In general. If I got
married again I'd be on the lookout for
what was going to be our inevitable
problems.

WILL
Odd conversation.

SARAH
It’s true. Everyone is crazy.

WILL
So, maybe don’t get married again.

PETER
Said the first husband.
ENOUGH SAID 65

SARAH
I'm not saying I will. I’m just saying.

EVA
(to Fran)
What was your first husband like?

FRAN
He was actually a lovely man. Just not
for me.

EVA

Oh. Very grown up!

FRAN
He passed away. Two years ago.

Peter attracts a WAITER.

PETER
Excuse me, could we have more bread?
WAITER
Of course.
EVA
Oh no, not more bread.
PETER
Why not?
EVA

I don’t want to eat it.

PETER
So don’t.

(to waiter)
More bread, please?

The waiter leaves.

EVA
Are you even going to eat it?

PETER
I don’t know. But the others might.

FRAN
I probably will.

WILL
Me, too.
ENOUGH SAID 66

PETER
Bread eater, another bread eater...

EVA
Okay, sorry.

EVA (CONT'D)
(like an interview)
So, Fran. You eat bread.

FRAN
It's true.

EVA

(to Peter)
Does that mean you can keep cookies in
the house?

PETER
I can.

CHLOE
What are you guys talking about?

EVA
I have a little trouble controlling
myself when it comes to sweets or bread,
so when Peter brought something like
cookies or chocolate or good bread home I
would eat all of it and then hate myself.

PETER
And me, for buying it in the first place.

CHLOE
So, did you stop buying it?

PETER
I did.

EVA
But he was angry.

PETER
I was not.

EVA
Well, just a little.

WILL
(to Peter)
You should be angry.
ENOUGH SAID

Why should you be deprived because she
can't control herself?

SARAH
Because she’s his wife and he’s trying to
help her?

WILL
But is that really helping her?

SARAH AND EVA
Yes!

WILL
Not if we want her to learn how to
control herself.

EVA
We??!

SARAH
(rolling her eyes)
Oh my god, here it comes.

WILL
It's not fair to him.

SARAH
Why does everything have to be fair?!
What are you, six!?

WILL
Come on, let’s keep it nice.

FRAN
(shrugging)
I just forget the cookies are there.

EVA
That's why you're married to Peter and
I’m not.

The WAITER COMES BY and puts the bread on the table.

takes some.

EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Everyone exits the restaurant.

Eva

67
ENOUGH SAID os

EVA
(to Peter)
Nobody ate the bread, by the way.

PETER
You did.

EVA
Exactly.

She starts to walk away but stops herself.

EVA (CONT’D)
What do you say to people when they asked
why we got divorced?

PETER
I usually just say we probably shouldn’‘t
have been together.

EVA
But Fran knows everything. I mean, you’ve
talked about me.

He looks at her as if to say “duh.”

EVA (CONT'D)
Of course. She’s your wife.

Eva and Peter join the others. While they all chat and laugh,
Eva stares at her ex husband, growing pensive and lonely.

INT. EVA'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Eva sits on the couch knitting a blanket. She’s also poring
over her and Peter’s WEDDING ALBUM. They look so happy and
young. Ellen and Chloe come through wearing pajamas.

EVA
Do you know I started this blanket when
you were five. Somehow I liked this
color. But I’m going to finish it so you
can take it with you.

ELLEN
Maybe I should buy another, just in case.

The girls glance at the wedding album.
ENOUGH SAID 69

ELLEN (CONT'D)
Why are you looking at this?

EVA
I don’t know. I pulled it out.
(staring hard at a picture)
I’m trying to remember what I knew. Did I
already know those things about your dad,
the things that we would fight about?

ELLEN
Probably not.

EVA
I think I did. I think I always knew
them. Or felt them.
(beat)
I didn’t pay attention.

Eva snaps out of her reverie and kisses Ellen.

EVA (CONT'D)
But look what I got.

She kisses Ellen.

ELLEN
‘Night Mom.

Eva holds onto her.

EVA
Stay up with me. Let’s cuddle.

ELLEN
I’m tired.

ELLEN (CONT'D)
Come on, Chloe.

CHLOE
(xe: knitting)
Is that hard?

EVA
Not at all. Want to learn?

(more to Ellen)
I've been wanting to teach Ellen for the
longest time...

Ellen goes out of the room and Chloe sits next to Eva. Eva’s
cell phone rings on the coffee table and Chloe leans over to
look at it.
ENOUGH SAID 70

CHLOE,
Albert.

After a beat, Eva shakes her head “no,” as in - don’t pick
up.

CHLOE (CONT'D)
You're still seeing his wife?

EVA
(defensive)
She has a bad shoulder. And no friends.

Chloe looks at her, disapproving.

EVA (CONT'D)
Don’t look at me like that. I’m screwed

up.

INT. MARIANNE'S HOUSE - DAY

Marianne, with her phone in her hand, and looking slightly
unhinged, lets Eva in.

MARIANNE
Sorry. In the middle of some bullshit.
Come in.

Eva takes off her shoes and sets up the massage table while
Marianne shouts into the phone.

MARIANNE (0.S.) (CONT'D)
How many times do we have to discuss
this? You did agree. Albert, I was there,
I remember. It’s all worked out...Fine.
Good bye. Ughhhhh!!! I can’t wait til I
don’t have to talk to him anymore!!

 

EVA
What happened?

MARIANNE
(pouring wine)
He thinks he should take her to school,
not me. We already agreed it would be me.
Tess wants it to be me. She told me.

EVA
Could you both take her?
ENOUGH SAID

MARIANNE
I don’t think so. He’s a wreck about her
leaving and she doesn’t need that kind of
energy.

They sit across from one another at the table.

MARIANNE (CONT'D)
He focuses so much on her and she can

feel it.
EVA
Isn't that kind of nice, though? That he
focuses?
MARIANNE

Maybe if he had a girlfriend, or
something like that, it would balance it
out. But I can’t see that happening.
Nope.

EVA
Why not?

MARIANNE
He’s just - a loser, you know? I hate to
use that word, but it fits.

Eva nods, her heart sinking.

EVA
How so?

MARIANNE
He just never got his life together.
Okay, for instance ~ and this is just
typical Albert. When I met him he had
nothing next to his bed, like a table or
something. Nothing. He’d put everything
on the floor. And I thought, this is
cute, kind of bohemian or whatever. But
when we got married I got us night
tables, you know, like normal people.
Then I was in his house, I don’t know, a
year ago. And I saw all his stuff on the
floor again. I mean, I took the night
tables, granted, but you'd think he’d get
some new ones. Metaphorically speaking,
he’s not building a life for himself. You
know what I mean?

The phone rings and she looks at it.

7
ENOUGH SAID 72

MARIANNE (CONT’D)
Ugh. That‘s him again. I’m not picking
up.

ALBERT ON PHONE MACHINE
Please pick up the phone, Marianne. We’ve
not resolved anything.

 

MARIANNE
I’m sorry you have to hear this. This is
so embarrassing.

ALBERT ON PHONE MACHINE
I know you're there. Fine. Don’t deal.

He hangs up. Eva is cringing, wishing she wasn’t hearing
this.

MARIANNE

(sad)
You know, these are all little things.
Ultimately, I think I just never felt
understood by him. He didn’t understand
my poetry. He just never got me.

(beat)
Have you ever felt like someone got you?

Eva thinks and breaks into a bittersweet smile, realizing how
much Albert does get her.

MARIANNE (CONT’D)
What about the flabby guy?

EVA
Yeah. Maybe.

INT. EVA'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - DAY

Eva is video chatting with Sarah, who is in her office. (WE
INTERCUT)

EVA
I need you to meet him.

SARAH
I mean, I’d love to meet him. But not so
you can decide what you think of him.

EVA
Please? I feel like I’m losing all
perspective.
ENOUGH SAID 73

SARAH
Exactly. You don’t need someone else’s. I
don’t want to get in the middle of this -

EVA
Please?

INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

Albert, Eva, Sarah and Will sit around the living room
drinking wine. They help themselves to a cheese plate, and
chips and guacamole.

WILL
No flowers, no little dots.

SARAH
I once bought sheets that had stars on
them and he -

WILL
(in baby voice)
Little stars and moons and suns -

ALBERT
Oh no.

WILL
Right? Why do women like things that look
like they belong to children?

EVA
I love doll house furniture. I would eat
it if I could.

SARAH
Sometimes I think I'd like to be single
just so I can have girly sheets.

WILL
You would like that, wouldn’t you?

SARAH
I'm kidding.

WILL
I hope so.

EVA
(pouring herself more wine)
I have flowered sheets and they’re not
all they’re cracked up to be.
ENOUGH SAID v4

ALBERT
I like your flowered sheets.

WILL
Don’t sell me out, man.

ALBERT
We‘re new. At this point I‘d probably
like her sheets if they had little
Mussolini’s on them.

EVA
Hey, get some night tables and we'll
talk.
(beat)
He’s got normal sheets but no night
tables.
ALBERT

So, I have no night tables.

EVA
Well, maybe it’s a metaphor. Or maybe
it’s not!

Albert flinches a bit - that hurt. He reaches for the
guacamole and starts to swirl the onions to the side. Eva
watches, wondering if this bothers her or not.

WILL
You know, I make a million compromises.
Not having flowery sheets is not a big
deal.

SARAH
(taken aback)
I know. I know you make compromises.

WILL
You do? What do you think they are?

SARAH
Will, this isn’t the time.

WILL
Sometimes I wish I was with someone who
was more interested in History.

SARAH
(beat, confused)
What?
ENOUGH SAID 1

WILL
History.

SARAH
Okay...

WILL

I’m just saying.

Very uncomfortable. Cathy, the maid, comes into the living
room and takes the empty guacamole bowl.

CATHY
More guacamole?

EVA
Not for me.

SARAH
or me.

ALBERT
I'd love some, thank you.

Cathy goes into the kitchen.

EVA
You know how many calories are in
guacamole?

ALBERT
Ten?

WILL
(mortified)
Leave the guy alone. He likes his
guacamole.

ALBERT
(to Cathy, in the kitchen)
Never mind the guac! I/1l just stick with
the cheese!

EVA
(drinking MORE wine)
You know what I’m going to get you for a
present? I’m going to get you a calorie
book.

ALBERT
Please don’t.
ENOUGH SAID 76

SARAH
Yeah, a calorie book as a gift isn’t so
good.
INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

Mid dinner, lots of wine.

ALBERT
Eva tells me you’re a therapist.
EVA
Tell us about your weirdest patient.
SARAH
What? You know I can’t.
WILL
She can’t.
EVA
She can. You don’t have to name names,
mate!
SARAH
No.
EVA
(to Albert)

She’s so uptight about confidentiality.

ALBERT
Shouldn’t she be?

SARAH
(beat)
I have this one patient who picks his
nose and eats it.

ALBERT
In front of you!?

EVA
Is he a child?

WILL
Are you making this up?

Sarah looks at him like he’s crazy.
ENOUGH SAID 17

SARAH
It’s so gross and distracting. He does it
in this way that he thinks I can’t see,
but of course I can.

Everyone is grossed out.
SARAH (CONT'D)
And I’m not going to tell you who it is,
but he’s famous.

They shriek.

SARAH (CONT'D)
Really famous.

EVA
Tell us!

WILL
I bet I know who it is.

SARAH
You don't.

EVA
You have to tell us!

WILL
I can’t tell you either.

EVA
Not fair!

SARAH
(guilty)
Okay no more. Show's over.

Eva pours more wine for herself.
EVA

I like being drunk. I think it’s highly
overrated. I mean underrated!

SARAH
You're shouting.
EVA
I am?
ALBERT

You are, a little.
ENOUGH SAID 78

SARAH
I just don’t want you to wake the little
people.

EVA

Oh sorry. Yeah. You want to know
something funny? Albert doesn’t know how
to whisper.

ALBERT
What?
EVA
Go ahead, show them.
ALBERT
What are you talking about?
EVA
Please? It’s funny.
ALBERT
(trying)
This is whispering.
WILL
That's a whisper.
EVA
No, it wasn’t.
SARAH
(whispering)
Can 1?
EVA
Yes.
WILL
(whispering)

What about me?

EVA
Yes.

Everyone turns to Albert. It looks like he’s going to have to
try to whisper again.

ALBERT
(not whispering)
This is whispering.

Eva cracks up, thinking this is hilarious.
ENOUGH SAID 79

EVA
Not at all. That is not a whisper!
SARAH
You're picking on him.
EVA
I am not!
WILL
You are.
ALBERT

You kind of are.

EVA
(beat)
I'm sorry. I just never met anybody who
couldn't whisper.

INT. SARAH AND WILL'S KITCHEN - LATER

Everyone’s in the kitchen, pitching in to clean with Cathy.
Cathy puts some stuff in the dishwasher and then goes back
into the dining room, leaving everyone alone for a second.
Sarah glares at Cathy’s back and Will notices.

WILL
(quietly)
You're not allowed to complain about her
anymore.

Sarah is holding up a softball.
SARAH
Why is this in the kitchen drawer? Is
someone playing ball in the kitchen?

Just then Cathy comes back in. Everyone smiles. Sarah takes a
beat and then holds up the ball.

SARAH (CONT'D)
Cathy?

CATHY
Yes?

SARAH
Did you put this ball in the drawer?

Eva and Albert instantly look away and act busy.
ENOUGH SAID 80

CATHY
Maybe one of the kids put it there?

WILL
(taking the ball)
Of course they did. Sarah, give Cathy a
break.

SARAH
But I think you put it there. I find
weird stuff in these drawers all the
time.

CATHY
I clean up the best I can.

SARAH
I just don’t understand the thought
process.

CATHY
You want the counter to be clean.

SARAH
Yes, but not by shoving shit in the wrong
drawers. I mean, why would the ball
belong in the kitchen? How is that
helpful to me?

WILL
That’s enough.

He pulls on Sarah’s shoulders.

CATHY
You know what Missus Sarah - I find your
crap everywhere and you think I know
where to put it?

SARAH
(scared)
No?

CATHY
You leave your things all over the house,
you leave food out overnight, you let
your children write on the walls! You
floss your teeth and you leave it! You
clean your own house.

She finds her purse and jacket.
ENOUGH SAID 81

CATHY (CONT’D)
You people disgust me. But you're nice,
Mr. Will.

WILL
Thanks Cathy!

She walks past Eva and Albert and slams the door behind her.

SARAH
Oh my god!

WILL
It would have been kinder to fire her.

EVA
Um, my timing might be a little off,
but... I think I put the ball in the
drawer.

INT. AUDI - NIGHT
Albert drives.

EVA
That wasn’t a very fun evening, was it?
I’m sorry.

Albert doesn’t respond.

EVA (CONT'D)
Quite a finale, though!

ALBERT
(pissed)
Why do you care if I can’t whisper?

EVA
What?

ALBERT
What was all that? That was so
embarrassing.

EVA
I was just kidding around.

ALBERT

(beat)
A calorie book? You want to buy me a
calorie book?
ENOUGH SAID 82

EVA
(beat)

I wasn't really going to buy you a

calorie book.

ALBERT
I thought you actually liked me.

EVA
(confused)
I do like you.

ALBERT
Why do I feel like I just spent the
evening with my ex-wife.

Eva looks at the street.

EVA
Wait. Are you driving me home?
ALBERT
Yeah.
EVA

Are you staying over?

ALBERT
No. Not tonight.

EVA
Oh.

EXT. EVA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Eva gets out of the car and Albert drives off.

INT. EVA'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Eva comes in and dumps her purse. She’s startled to see Chloe
lying down in the living room. But kind of relieved.

CHLOE
(sitting up)

Hi. Ellen went out with friends but I

don’t want to go home. Is it okay?

EVA
I’m actually glad you’re here.
ENOUGH SAID 83

They curl up together.

CHLOE
I feel so much more comfortable at your
house.

EVA

You know, you're welcome to stay in
Ellen’s room when she’s gone. You'd have
to talk to your mom but it’s just gonna

be empty.

CHLOE
Really?

EVA
Sure.

CHLOE

That would be awesome. Thank you.

INT. EVA'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The TV is on and Eva and Chloe are asleep among their
knitting. Ellen comes in the front door and stands over them.

ELLEN
(to Chloe)

Excuse me, Chloe, but could I have my mom

back?

They sit up, groggy.

EVA
We were watching something and I guess we
just passed out.

Ellen goes to her room, angry.
ELLEN
For all I know you'll be asking her to
move into my room when I’m gone!

She leaves the room and they hear THE BEDROOM DOOR SLAM SHUT.

CHLOE
I’m sorry.

EVA
Not your fault, sweetie.
ENOUGH SAID 84

CHLOE
I better go home.

INT. ELLEN’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

Ellen is packing things into boxes. Eva comes in and sits on
the bed.

EVA

Honey. Chloe is needy.
ELLEN

Who's needy?

(beat)

I’m guess I’m trying to feel a little
separate, you know, to sort of prepare.
But instead I just feel lonely and
anxious and Chloe’s always here!

EVA
I’m so sorry.

Eva holds out her arms.

EVA (CONT'D)
Honey. You know you're my baby.

Ellen ignores her and continues to put things in piles.

EVA (CONT'D)
Please let me hug you. Let mama hug you.

More ignoring. Eva sighs.
EVA (CONT'D)
(beat)
Can I see what Dad and Fran got you?
Ellen points to a new blanket.
EVA (CONT'D)
I'm going to finish my blanket. What else
did they get you?
Ellen holds up some nice hangers.
EVA (CONT'D)

Oh, those are good. They don’t take up a
lot of room.
ENOUGH SAID 85

Ellen continues putting clothes in boxes and Eva sits there,
not knowing what else to say.

EXT. MARIANNE’S BACK PATIO - DAY

Eva is setting her up massage table in the patio. Marianne is
fooling with a plant in her garden.

MARIANNE
Did you get a chance to look at my book?

EVA
I did. Your poems are beautiful. Not that
I understand them, but I like them.

MARIANNE
Thanks. I’m sure you understand them.

Eva mouths “No, I don’t” but Marianne doesn’t see. The front
door slams.

TESS (0.S.)
Mom?

MARIANNE
Out here honey.

Eva freezes, looking down and away. Tess doesn’t notice her
at first.

TESS
Hi. Dad's waiting in the car. I forgot my
phone.
MARIANNE
Honey, I want you to meet -
TESS
(sees her)
Eva. Hi.
EVA
(feigning surprise)
Tess?
MARIANNE

You guys know each other?
ENOUGH SAID 86

TESS
Yes, we know each other. She’s dating
Dad.

Marianne turns and looks at Eva. Eva pretends she’s shocked.

EVA
What?

MARIANNE,
You date Albert?

EVA
Huh? I’m not sure what’s happening - I
think, wait a minute -

Just then the front door slams.

ALBERT (0.S.)
Hello?

TESS
We’re out here, Dad.

After a moment Albert walks to the patio.
ALBERT
Oh, hey. Sorry to interrupt.
(turning to Eva)
Hi, I’m -

He looks at Eva.

EVA
Hi?

ALBERT
I don’t understand. What are you doing
here?

MARIANNE

She gives me massages. We're friends.
(looking at Eva, hurt)
I thought.

Albert looks at them and takes it all in.

ALBERT
What?

(beat)
You're friends with Marianne?
ENOUGH SAID 87

EVA
I met her at a party and she took my
card.
MARIANNE
I think you were at the same party.
ALBERT
And you met us both?
(beat)
So, what? You're her masseuse?
EVA
Yeah!
ALBERT
For how long?
MARIANNE
Right after we met.
EVA
I had no idea who she was or who you
were.
ALBERT
But you must have figured it out. At some
point.
EVA
No!
ALBERT
No?
EVA
Well, yeah, at some point.
ALBERT
When?
EVA
What?
ALBERT

When did you figure it out?
Eva stalls, not knowing what to say.
ALBERT (CONT’D)

(beat)
Come on Tess. You got your phone?
ENOUGH SAID 88

TESS
Yeah. Um. Okay.

Albert walks out and Tess follows. Eva’s devastated. She gets
her stuff as Marianne, sits, shocked and hurt.

EVA
I’m so sorry.

And Eva leaves.

EXT. EVA'S HOUSE - SOON AFTER

Eva walks up to her house and sees Chloe sitting on the front
steps waiting for her.

EVA
Hi.

CHLOE
(concerned)
You all right? Is it okay I’m here?

EVA
Probably not.

Eva sits down next to her.

EVA (CONT'D)
I screwed up big time.

CHLOE
What happened?

EVA
(head in her hands)
Oh my god oh my god...

Just then Chloe’s mother Debbie drives up and gets out of the
car.

DEBBIE
Chloe.
CHLOE
Hi Mom.
DEBBIE
(to Eva)

Excuse me, do you have a daughter?
ENOUGH SAID 89

EVA
What?

Debbie gets in her face.

DEBBIE
‘cause this ones mine. Who do you think
you are, telling her she should have sex
with her boyfriend?

EVA
I - I didn’t.

CHLOE,
Mom!

Debbie pulls Chloe up.
DEBBIE

You stay away from my daughter. And keep
your opinions to yourself.

EVA
But - she needs to talk about what’s
important to her and -

Debbie stops her.
DEBBIE
Shut. It.
(beat)
Dyke.

The last remark is so random Eva laughs. And then doesn't.

EXT. YOUNG MAN'S HOUSE - DAY

Eva climbs the stairs without help, miserably trying to get
on with her day.

INT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT - DAY

The man with the bad breath is getting a massage. Luckily for
Eva, his mouth is closed. She massages slowly and
automatically, lost in thought.
ENOUGH SAID 90

INT. BRENTWOOD HOUSE - DAY
Eva massages Cynthia as she blabs on about her butcher block

and travertine tiles. Eva shuts her eyes, trying to tune her
out.

EXT. ALBERT’S STREET - ANOTHER DAY
Eva's prius drives toward Albert’s house. She gets out of the

car just as Tess is coming outside with a big box of
Cinnabons.

EXT. ALBERT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

EVA
Hi.

TESS
Hi.

EVA

Is he here?

TESS
He went to the market.

EVA
I'm sorry to just come over but he won't
call me back.

TESS
I'll tell him you came by.

But Eva just stands there, not going anywhere.

EVA
What are you going to do with that?

TESS
You want one?

Tess sits and Eva sits beside her, taking a Cinnabon. Just
then Albert drives up.

He gets out of his car with a couple of grocery bags. Eva
rises, nervous, holding the Cinnabon.

EVA
Hi.
ENOUGH SAID 91

ALBERT
(cold)
You know how many calories are in that?

He goes inside. Eva follows him.
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Eva comes in as he’s putting away the food.

EVA
I just want to talk.

He gives her a look as if to say “so talk.”

EVA (CONT’D)
It really was a coincidence and then I
wanted to stop but she needed massages
and we sort of became friends and I
didn’t know what to do.

ALBERT
You knew exactly what to do. You just
didn't do it.

EVA
I was very torn.

ALBERT
And while you were being torn she was
poisoning our relationship? Poisoning
your perception of me?

EVA
Yes.

ALBERT
And why would you want that?

EVA
I don’t know! I guess I was trying to
protect myself. You know, we’ve both been
married before, and we know how things
can turn out.

ALBERT
And what about us? You didn’t protect us.

EVA
I didn’t protect us. But it’s not
poisoned Albert, I still really want us
to keep seeing each other.
ENOUGH SAID 92

ALBERT
I wouldn't know how.

EVA
I’m so, so sorry.

ALBERT
This might sound corny, but you broke my
heart. And I’m too old for that shit. And
the worst part, the worst part is that
you made me look like an idiot in front
of my daughter.

EVA
I'm the idiot. I’m the idiot!

He looks at her, not sure what to say.

He goes to
Eva walks

ALBERT
I've got a lot to do. Tess and school -

EVA
When is she leaving?

ALBERT
In a week. School starts early.

EVA
That's when Ellen leaves.
(trying to be light)
Guess we're gonna need to get those
hobbies going, huh?

ALBERT
Guess so.

put away the groceries, his back to her. Torn up,
out.

EXT. ALBERT’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Eva goes t

Eva turns.

o the front door when she sees Tess in the doorway.

EVA
Bye.

TESS
He just really, really liked you.
ENOUGH SAID 93

EVA
I just really liked him.

And she leaves Albert's house.

INT. EVA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Eva lies in bed and sighs deeply, staring at the ceiling.

INT. ELLEN’S ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

Eva enters Ellen’s room with the finished, hand knitted
blanket. She places it in a suitcase on the floor. She looks
around at what’s left of her daughter’s whole life, and sits
on the bed. The closet has been stripped mostly bare. The
walls are blank. The bedding is gone.

Ellen stands in the doorway and then sits beside her on the
bed. Eva takes her hand.

They glance at one another - the kind of glance that
acknowledges the bittersweet nature of life, and that no
matter how hard we try, it will always win.

INT. LOS ANGELES AIRPORT - SAME DAY
Eva, Peter and Ellen stand before the security line.

EVA
How will you know which room is yours?

ELLEN
It’s all written down. And we saw
everything on our visit.

EVA
(anxious)
I don’t remember anything.

ELLEN
I do.

PETER
She’s gonna be great.

EVA
(weakly)
You'll be fine!
ENOUGH SAID 94

ELLEN
I love you guys.

Ellen hugs and kisses them both and after a beat, lets go of
them. They stand there.

Reluctantly they all turn around and head toward the security
area. It’s takes an agonizing long time as Ellen gets her
ticket checked, and she leaves them, going to the escalator.
Eva tries to her best not to cry too much, Peter is doing the
same. As Ellen ascends, she turns, seeing her parents grow
smaller and smaller. And her parents, at last, see her
disappear in the crowd.

They turn, walking away. Eva breathes deeply and Peter puts
his arm around her.

PETER
We made a fine person.

Eva puts her arm around him as well and they walk out of the
airport.

DISSOLVE TO:
EXT. YOUNG MAN’S HOUSE ~ DAY

Eva pulls her massage table out of her car and begrudgingly
starts up the steps to the house. After a moment, Hal comes

out and smiles.

HAL
Hi Eval

He watches her struggle, smiling. Half way up she suddenly
turns up to him.

EVA
Do you think you could help me?

Hal rushes down the stairs.

HAL
Of course. Oh my god, I’m such an idiot!

He takes the table out of her hands and hustles it up the
stairs.

HAL (CONT’D)
God, this is heavy!

Eva walks up behind him, surprised and confused.
ENOUGH SAID 95

INT. BRENTWOOD HOUSE - DAY
Eva is massaging Cynthia’s neck.

CYNTHIA
Well, we always go to my parents for
thanksgiving and we always get into a
fight. My sister is a middle child so
she’s got those issues - hey, what are
you going to be doing?

EVA
Huh?

CYNTHIA
For the holiday?

EVA
Oh, just going to a friends house. It’s
going to be small.

CYNTHIA
That sounds nice.

EVA
Oh yeah. It will be.

EXT. SARAH AND WILL’S HOUSE - DAY

Eva, in a sweater, gets out of her car with some groceries,
walks up to the front door and opens it.

INT. SARAH AND WILL'S HOUSE - MORNING

She walks into the kitchen and puts the groceries on the
counter. Sarah, wearing a robe, is preparing some food.

EVA
Hi.
SARAH
Hi honey. Thank you so much.
EVA
No problem.
SARAH

(unloading groceries)
Are you excited?
ENOUGH SAID 96

EVA
Beyond.

SARAH
Do you think she’s going to look
different?

EVA
Maybe she grew a beard. You know how it
is at Sarah Lawrence. She looks the same.
I skyped with her yesterday. Actually, I
think she gained a little weight.

SARAH
What time you getting her?

EVA
Not til two.

SARAH
We‘re eating at five. You should come
straight here from the airport.

Cathy walks into the kitchen and takes down a bunch of
plates.

SARAH (CONT'D)
Oh, let’s use the fancy plates instead.

CATHY
You said you don’t like them.

SARAH
Yeah, but it’s Thanksgiving. You're
supposed to use ugly plates.

EVA
I’m gonna get going.

Sarah opens the silverware drawer and sees a hair brush where
She rolls her eyes and looks at Eva, who smiles.

EVA (CONT'D)
I'll see ya.

CATHY
Bye Eva.

EVA
Bye Cathy.

Eva leaves.
ENOUGH SAID 97

INT. EVA‘S CAR - DAY

She sits in her car and doesn’t drive. After a moment, she
checks her appearance in the mirror.

EXT. ALBERT’S HOUSE - DAY

Eva drives up and parks across the street. She stares at the
house and can see the living room. After a moment, Albert is
there. And he sees her.

She freezes. She doesn’t know what to do, so she gives a
stupid little wave. He walks away from the window.

Her heart sinks.

EVA
Okay.

She's about to drive away when he comes out of the house and
stands on the front steps. She takes this as her cue and gets
out and goes over.

EVA (CONT’D)
I don’t often park in front of your

house.
(beat)
Usually I just drive by.
ALBERT
I've driven by your house, too.
EVA
(thrilled)

You have?
He nods. He sits and she sits beside him.

EVA (CONT'D)
You look good.

ALBERT
So do you.

EVA
Is Tess coming home?

ALBERT
Already here. She’s at her mom’s. I’m
going over there soon. Wanna come?
ENOUGH SAID 98

Eva laughs, the ice breaking.

ALBERT (CONT'D)

And Ellen?
EVA
This afternoon. She’s coming home this
afternoon.
ALBERT

So, you've been okay, without her?

EVA
Oh yeah. But she’s not going back because
I've built a cage.

ALBERT
What a good idea.

EVA
I’ve missed you.

He looks at her, his face softening.

ALBERT
I’ve missed you too.

They smile at one another.

ALBERT (CONT’D)
(beat)
Oh, I thought you should know. I bought
some night tables.

EVA
(surprised)
You did?
ALBERT
No.
Eva laughs.
EVA

Okay. That's good.

And she looks at Albert, feeling gratitude and possibly love.
