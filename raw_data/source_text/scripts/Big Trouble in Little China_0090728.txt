EXT. SAUSALITO - CHINESE HERITAGE MUSEUM - NIGHT
INT. MUSEUM

In the middle of a marble floor, a single display case topped
by a crystal dome. DISTANT BUZZING. A SHAFT of light
appears. Then a BURNING INCENSE STICK. mm wafts down.

TWISTING PULL OUT

The incense stick is upside down, being lowered into the
room. As the smoke spreads, it reveals laser beams that form
a security barrier.

The incense stick is held by a muscular hand, followed by a
powerful forearm sporting the tattoo of a Chinese Dragon.

Black hair, a black headband with red Chinese characters,
dark eyes in a handsome, upside-down face; followed by the
rest of BOBBY WANG -- in red muscle shirt and black jeans.

He is tied upside-down with a red nylon rope. His powerful
body moves like a contortionist to avoid the interlocking
laser matrix as he's lowered toward the display case.

A thin tube slides down his arm. A liquid drops onto the
glass and HISSES as it flows in rivulets down the side. Bobby
takes a hammer, covers the crystal with a cloth and taps it
gently. CRACK. Bobby carefully pries a piece away. He reaches
in and plucks a JADE ARTIFACT from its pedestal.

CU - THE ARTIFACT

THE CHAI TAO... a piece of jade carved into part of a Chinese
ideogram... a puzzle in Chinese characters.

MATCH DISSOLVE
CU - COMPUTER

A 3D rendering of the JADE PIECE rotates. Text windows appear
connecting it to historical references..."T'ang Dynasty."
INT. ASSISTANT CURATOR'S OFFICE ~- SAME TIME

STEVE TAYLOR studies his computer. He's 29, smart and
confident. He studies a hologram of the SAME JADE ARTIFACT.
Using a voice-recognition computer, he tries to fit it and
TWO OTHER SHAPES into a complete CHINESE PUZZLE; the CHAI
TAO. He's also on the phone.

STEVE
.. ROTATE LEFT 10.
Yeah Dad, I know what time it
is but I thought you'd like to
know. The piece we just put on
display, I think I found out
what it really is. Something
even more interesting! Yeah!
A piece of the Chai Tao! The
CHAI TAO! Well, according to
legend it was created by YAMA,
the God of Hell. It's the key
to unearthly power.

CU COMPUTER SCREEN

The 3D model, breaks into three pieces, two phantom pieces
rendered in wire-frame, the museum's piece in full color.

STEVE
It disappeared. ..around
580 AD. Rumored to be separated

into THREE PIECES, each piece
held by certain moral humans for
safety.

ANGLE - SURVEILLANCE MONITOR - OVER SHOULDER

One security camera is picking up Bobby Wang, but Steve
doesn't notice.

STEVE
No, it's not the complete
Chai Tao, but it sure looks
like one of the pieces!
TILT Z AXIS BACK TEN.
What? I don't know. Priceless!
ZOOM IN 20.
STEVE (CONT'D.)
I found it in the Fung collection.
Maybe old man Fung was a sorcerer.
What? Of course it'll be here in
the morning, but it's so exciting
I just thought you'd like to know.
No? Really?

INT. GALLERY - BOBBY

He slowly slips the JADE from the case, puts it in his
pocket. As he does, he dislodges the hammer. It drops from
his pocket, hits the glass with a PING. The glass shatters
and falls, cutting the laser beams. ALARM! Bobby screams a
command into a throat mike.

BOBBY
Heur-La! Fi-dee! Heur-La! HEUR-LA!
(Go! Now! Go go go!)
Giou La! (Let's get out of here!)

INT. ASSISTANT CURATOR'S' OFFICE - SAME TIME

Steve's still on the phone, engrossed in the puzzle when
ALARMS BLAST.
STEVE

What's that? It's nothing...

Just the alarm.

(suddenly realizes)

Look, I gotta go! Bye Dad!

(slams down the phone.)

Damn!

He leaps up, runs out.

EXT. HERITAGE MUSEUM - ANOTHER FLAME LORD

YEE, an Asian-American kid in black jacket and headset pops
the clutch of a Ninja Cycle, ROARS off.

ZOOM IN AND HOLD ON THE CYCLE

Tied to the back pommel is the red rope. As he rockets away,
the taut rope whips by.

ON THE ROOF

A pulley in a tripod spins madly...as
INT. MUSEUM

BOBBY is rocketed straight up and out.

EXT. THE ROOF

Bobby FLIES into the arms of Flame Lords. They grab his gear,
stuff it into packs. They tie the rope to the tripod, hook
onto it and drop off the roof.

FLAME LORDS - TRAVELING

They powerslide down the rope and drop to the lawn, hitting
with a rolling tumble that brings them up to their bikes. Yee
leaps off the ninja cycle as Bobby vaults right into the
seat.

WIDE ANGLE

The Lords take off. Still roped to the tripod, Bobby guns it.
EXT. ROOF

The tripod SNAPS FREE, LEAPS off the roof.

EXT. GROUND

The tripod hits and tumbles, dragged by the Cycle.

ANGLE BOBBY - TRAVELING

He roars by as GUARDS run out screaming into radios. The
tripod tumbles across the lawn.

STEVE runs out, sees the Flame Lords ZOOM by. A ROAR.

He turns.

STEVE'S POV

A CYCLE bears down on him. Bobby grins maniacally.

Steve DARTS left. The CYCLE darts LEFT.

STEVE darts RIGHT. The CYCLE leans RIGHT

STEVE feints LEFT, dives RIGHT, just as

The CYCLE RIPS BY...
Steve goes tumbling. He rolls and flips onto his feet, about
to give chase when he notices the rope whipping at his feet.
He turns. The tripod tumbles straight at him. He dives to the
side, lands in a fountain. He comes up spewing water.

 

EXT. MUSEUM FRONT GATE

COP CARS pull up, SIRENS WAILING, LIGHTS FLASHING, blocking
the exit.

THE CYCLE - TRAVELING
Bobby whips out a sword. With one swipe he parts the rope.

He rockets up the front hood of a cop car and launches over
it. Cops tumble out. They hop back in, just as...

THE TRIPOD
tumbles up and smashes into the cars, wedging between them.
CU - FLAME LORDS - TRAVELING

Five young men and women of mixed ethnic types, mostly Asian-
Americans in leather jackets with Red Dragons. They wear head
bands with Chinese characters. The cycles sport dragon
pennants. They're neon streaks as they ROAR by.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - CHINATOWN

More cops join the chase and close in. The FLAME LORDS slam
into LITTLE CHINA, swerve around blind corners, boots kicking
sparks. They roar up a culvert. Cop cars appear at the top.
Lords swerve, pull up, surrounded.

The Lords gun their choppers up a ramp into an alley which
turns into a luge tube. They rocket down out of sight.

In a flash they are gone. In Little China they are
invincible, protected by an architecture of secret ramps,
tunnels and bridges. Two cops run up, find them vanished,
scratch their heads in disbelief.

HEME SIC Z E_MONTAGE
A mix of stills, animation and live action featuring magic
and martial arts. Scenes from the first "Big Trouble" movie

remind us that this is a world where anything can happen.

EXT. STREETS OF LITTLE CHINA - NEXT MORNING

Steve and CLARENCE JAMES, a bearish, black SFPD Detective,
walk though Chinatown. Steve's haggard, sleepless, stressed
out and exasperated. Clarence grins and waves to merchants.
He is known and liked in Little China. He takes a fresh
lichee nut from a fruit stand, nods to the grocer, pops it
into his mouth.

STEVE
Listen, I already told this
to the guys downtown.

CLARENCE
Indulge me. Tell me again.
Try one of these, they're great.

Lu Wong, a Chinese merchant waves to him.

STEVE
I haven't had any sleep!

e Clarence takes another fruit.

CLARENCE
Insomnia?! Ah... Lo quats!
Good for the blood. Thanks Lu.

STEVE
You believe that?

CLARENCE
Listen, kid. There are really two
Chinatowns. The one you know is
restaurants and knick knack shops.
The one you don't know is a mystery.
You know, wizards, magic, that kind
of stuff.

STEVE looks at Clarence quizzically.

CLARENCE (CONT'D.)
I know it sounds funny, but
they believe it. And it affects
how they behave.
STEVE
Like breaking into a museum to
steal an artifact, you mean?

CLARENCE
Yeah, exactly. Now, tell me again,
what were those motorcycle guys
wearing?

STEVE
Black jackets with red dragons.

CLARENCE
Flame Lords.

STEVE
Flame Lords?

CLARENCE
You know about the Lords?

STEVE
Who hasn't?

CLARENCE
They work for Chi Lung. A real
@ charmer. Extortion, smuggling,
white slavery... Nothing we can
pin on him yet. Any blue and green
cycles?

STEVE
No. Why?

CLARENCE
White Hearts. Rival gang. Run by
Egg Shen, another local character.

STEVE
Egg Shen? Isn't he some sort of martial
arts master?

CLARENCE
Oh, he's kind of an old crack pot
but he's got lots of interests in
Chinatown. A tour bus company...a
curio shop. He's also supposed to be
involved in the occult.

Steve turns to him, curiously.
STEVE
The occult?

CLARENCE
It's Chinatown, pal. Some of
our guys come outta there
babbling about demons, magic
potions and stuff.

STEVE
Really? Egg Shen, eh?

CLARENCE
This stuff may sound silly to us,
but it's very real to them.

STEVE
It doesn't sound silly to me.
I studied Asian mysticism at
Berkeley.

Clarence looks at him curiously, then shrugs.

CLARENCE
The older Chinese still believe
in magic. Chi Lung and the Flame
eS Lords take advantage of that.
Gives them power. There was big
trouble here a few years ago.
Some truck driver wandered in,
got himself shanghaied by devils
at least that's what some people
here think. Personally, I think
the boys got hold of too much plum
wine. But it raised a hell of a
stink downtown.

STEVE
Devils? Well...magic or no magic.
I have to get the jade back.

CLARENCE
What's so special about it?

STEVE
If it's what I think it is, it's
the piece of a puzzle. A very,

very interesting puzzle.

Clarence just looks at him straight-faced...Then turns and
grabs a sweetsour bun from a vendor.
STEVE
Hey!

He suddenly stops, points to the street corner.
EXT, GRANT STREET

In the crowd, Yee, the Flame Lord. He spots Steve, turns and
takes off, slipping into the crowd.

STEVE (CONT'D.)
That's one of them!
One of the thieves!

Clarence looks up from helping himself to a Chinese pastry.
He sees Steve bolt, turns, slams into a delivery boy. Chow

Fun noodles fly all over the street. Clarence and the boy go
down, all tangled up.

CLARENCE
Wait! Hey, wait!

But Steve's off and running. Clarence struggles up but
teve's already gone, disappearing into the crowd.

STEVE - TRAVELING

Zipping in and out of the crowd, bumping tourists. He runs
up a street lined with shops for herbal medicines, food,
tourist goods.

Ahead, a glimpse. The Flame Lord's headband disappears around
a corner.

STEVE -

Broken field running through the crowd, over trash cans,
around barriers. He turns the corner and finds himself in...

EXT. KUNG ALLEY

...a QUIET, DESERTED SIDE STREET off the tourist track, lined
with the dim windows of small shops. But the Flame Lord has
disappeared.

STEVE'S POV

A Pacific Power truck is parked in front of a SMALL CURIO
SHOP. A boom is extended and a worker is affixing a power
line to the building. BRAD, a youth in a hard hat, sets out
barricades, yells to his partner in the boom basket.
Steve notices the partner, a pretty Asian-American woman. KIM
CHAN, 22, wearing a t-shirt and jeans. She cannot hide her
beauty under a hard hat. As she leans out of her basket to
wrestle with the power lines, Steve is drawn to stare.

rad's a body builder with a Gold's Gym T-shirt and a Forrest
Gump/Fast Times at Ridgemont High demeanor. He has the hots
for Kim but they're co-workers. There's an underlying sexual
tension as he controls her basket height.

KIM
Down a little. Up a touch..
Ahh...that's it. Down. There,
that's good.

BRAD
Yeah, it was good for me. How
was it for you?

ANGLE KIM

She's very pretty, lithe and strong. She leans over her pod
attaching wires, glances down at Brad grinning up at her.

KIM
Don't start with me, Brad. Try
to be professional for once.
ANGLE BRAD
He glowers, mumbles to himself.
BRAD
What the hell am I supposed to do,
work with my eyes closed?
STEVE
See a guy in a red headband come
through here?
Steve's standing on a power cable. Brad moves him back.
BRAD
Excuse me, pal. Don't stand there,

please. We've got hot stuff up there.

STEVE
Yeah, I see.

Kim leans over, straining her t-shirt. She's very sexy.
w
t

BRAD
The wires, I mean.

STEVE
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

Brad looks up at Kim impatiently.

BRAD
Think you'll get that tied off
before the Year of the Weasel is
ever and the Year of the Banana Slug
begins?

STEVE
Actually, it's the Year of the Pig.

BRAD
The Pig. Oh. Good.

KIM
Hey Brad, it's your year.

BRAD
Yah, funny.
(to Steve)
Well, it’s gonna be the year of
the fat lip if you don't get off
my cable.
(he coils cable,mumbling to himself)
I'm in the truck with her all day.
It's driving me nuts.
(notices Steve's still there)
Something I can do for you, buddy?

STEVE
A guy. About twenty. Red Headband.
Black and red jacket. Flame Lord.

BRAD
I didn't see nothing. ‘Specially no
Flame Lord.

STEVE
How about an antique shop?

BRAD
This whole neighborhood is one big
antique shop.

STEVE
I'm looking for Egg Shen's.
12.

He shows Brad his map. Brad studies it, glances up.

BRAD
You're in luck, pal. You're here.

He points at the sign EGG SHEN ANTIQUITIES hidden by Kim's
basket. Steve looks around. He senses eyes watching him.
Then, a shout!

KIM
Hey! You gonna get those ties or
what?

They look up at the impatient girl hanging over the basket.

BRAD
Keep your shirt on!
(sees her stiffen, hands the map back)
Damn! I'm a diabetic in a candy
shop!

Grumbling, he turns, slams open the truck doors -- WHANG!

Kim glances down at Steve. Their eyes meet for an instant,
then she turns back to her work.

Steve turns to the CURIO SHOP, stares in the window.
INT. EGG SHEN ANTIQUITES SHOP - STEVE'S POV

It's dark. Nooks and crannies are stuffed with Oriental
curiosities. The window sports pieces of jade.

STEVE
(to himself; surprise, wonder)
Min din yuk! Burma jade...Wow!

The shopkeeper, EGG SHEN, an old but tough Chinese, looks up
from his antiquities and stares back. He comes to the front
and looks out. Steve excitedly indicates the jade.

STEVE
Is that goo yuk, that sun shan
yuk? (antique jade, new jade)

EGG SHEN
Who are you, Bok gwei?

EXT. SHOP - STEVE

It seems that Egg Shen is looking past him toward KIM... up
on the boom. He's polishing something.
be

STEVE
Ngor hai gai dook shu.
(I'm a student, an acolyte.)
Ngor man nee see gow.
(I need your advice.)
I seek wisdom.

EGG SHEN
You seek pronunciation. You
just called yourself a cabbage leaf...
but I'm impressed.

CU - EGG SHEN'S HANDS

He polishes a jade piece. It's similar to the museum piece,
put not identical.

ANGLE - STEVE

Steve focuses in on it. He can't quite see. He's about to
make a move toward the shop when he sees a reflection in the
glass. He turns.

ACROSS THE STREET

Yee stares at him, tapping ninja-sticks in his palm... From
other corners other Flame Lords appear. SFX - BOOMING CYCLE
ENGINES. Flame Lord choppers turn a corner and ROAR up.

The Lords pull up, REVVING their choppers. One kicks over a
barrier. It slams into Brad's truck with a LOUD BOOM! Brad
rockets out of the truck holding his head and SCREAMING.

BRAD
Hey! What the... !?

Bobby Wang just laughs at him. Brad stops dead in his tracks.
Two other Flame Lords move up grinning and swinging ninja
sticks. One says something demeaning in a Dialect. Others
laugh, snicker, move to surround Brad. He backs away.

ANGLE - CURIO SHOP

Flame Lords zoom past. An ancient Chinese nimbly darts out of
their way. But Steve doesn't move fast enough. A Lord slams
into him, knocks him down.

KIM

looks down.
KIM'S POV

Brad is quickly surrounded, threatened.

THE STREET

Bobby and the Lords move at Brad, enjoying his growing fear.
While others move on Steve...

BOBBY
Goo Gee! La! Say Liang Jye!
(Be careful, jerk)

A FIGURE DROPS into the confrontation; KIM. The Lords jump
back, see a pretty girl, move forward. Kim glares them down.

KIM
Bo Woo Ah! Jye...!
(Get ready, stupid)

What she says inflames the Lords. One moves on her. Brad
grabs her, pulis her back.

BRAD
Kim, are you nuts? They're
Flame Lords.

KIM
I don't care! They are scum...
KER DEY HAI GEU!!!
(They are pigs!)
She's angry, not intimidated. She snaps a kick that brushes
the Lord's nose and snaps his head back. He stumbles back.
Kim takes a stand. The Lords surround her, mumbling threats.

STEVE
Why don't you leave her alone?

They stop, turn. Steve gets up.

BOBBY
Why would we do that?

STEVE
You're bothering her.

He turns on Steve...threatening. Moves up into his face,
grins menacingly.

BOBBY
It's our job. We're Flame Lords.
STEVE
know who you are.

BOBBY
And we know who you are.

STEVE
Yeah, Seems we keep running into each
other. Listen, I want to talk to you.

BOBBY
About what?

STEVE
The jade you stole from the
Heritage Museum.

The Lords stiffen, look to Bobby Wang. Bobby moves forward.

BOBBY
Cop?

STEVE
Assistant Curator.

A beat... Bobby starts giggling.
BOBBY
Oh....worse. Assistant Curator!

Very scary!
The Lords snicker, then snap into a menacing stance.

Steve takes a defensive martial-arts stance. They stop and
look at his moves. Then they laugh.

BOBBY
No, no, no. It's like this.

He snaps into a very serious stance; deadly, practiced,
agressive. The other Flame Lords also click into exaggerated
poses. They put on a demonstration of much better moves.
Superfast fighting, flying, tumbling. Bobby finishes with a
tumbling, whipping combo that catches Steve by surprise,
sending him into a pile of garbage.

BOBBY
You should leave Little China,
BOK GWEI! (white ghost/Anglo)

Steve jumps to his feet. Bobby moves toward him. they mix it
up. Steve is surprisingly good. They exchange quick combos.
16.

KIM (0.S.)
DA-LA, Saw Jye!
(Go ahead, fight, stupids!)

They turn.
KIM

is moving into an attack stance. Yee goes for her. In a
quick, surprising combo, Kim flips, tumbles, kicks, punches
and sends Yee through the window of CHEE FUN LAUNDRY. He
stumbles out, covered in dry cleaning. Bobby laughs.

BOBBY
Nei gum lyang! You're beautiful!

KIM
Nei gum aie! You're short.

BOBBY
(he laughs delightedly)
You're angry.
(swings onto his chopper)
..I...like that. Get on.

KIM
Get lost.

He likes that, too. He's about to mess with her more when he
HEARS SIRENS O.S.!

BOBBY
Yeah, not a bad idea.

To create a diversion, Bobby breaks the Curio Shop window and
sets off the ALARM! A quick, unexpected blow sends Steve into
the garbage again. Bobby turns to Kim.

BOBBY
I'll see you again.

KIM
(sarcastic)
I'll lie awake nights.
He laughs, nods to the Flame Lords.
ANGLES -THE FLAME LORDS

They race off.
EGG SHEN
rushes out of his shop.

EGG SHEN
Flame Lords!!!
(they hesitate)
Nei gall guy! You're off limits!

A beat...then Bobby steps up to him.

BOBBY
Hey, old man, what kind of gang
would we be if we obeyed the
rules?

Bobby hops on his cycle, gives Egg a mock salute, pops the
clutch, SCREECHES away. Lords vanish into the woodwork.

ANGLE - KIM AND BRAD
Brad's awestruck at Kim's fighting skills.
BRAD
Geez, Kim! Where'd you learn

to do that?

KIM
Women's support group.

She walks up to Steve, lying in the garbage, picking fish
heads out of his hair. Kim stands over him, hands on hips.

KIM
Thanks for your help.
STEVE
Don't mention it.
KIM
But you shouldn't interfere.
Not here.
STEVE

Sorry. Thought you were in trouble.
Obviously, a mistake.

KIM
(she studies him)
The Flame Lords are dangerous. You
better leave Little China.

17.
STEVE
What about you?

KIM
I work here. Anyway...they'll leave
me alone.

STEVE

Yeah, so I see.

She looks him up and down, then notices Egg. Steve follows
her look, sees Egg picking up jade from his smashed display.
They approach. Egg looks up, notices their interest.

EGG SHEN
It's not wise to stand against
the Flame Lords.

KIM
I can take care of myself.

EGG SHEN
Yes, I observed.

Egg hands Kim a jade piece.

EGG SHEN
Jade...magical. The only gemstone
that changes color when you touch
it. It reacts to body temperature,
chemistry...some say...to the
person himself. Or herself.

CU - THE JADE

It turns lighter in Kim's hand.

ANGLE - EGG

He studies the jade and Kim. He seems to see something.

He smiles at Kim, slips back into his store. Kim and Steve
look at each other for an awkward moment. Kim admires the

small gift of jade. She notices a broom, grabs it and starts
sweeping glass fragments into the gutter.

KIM

You're lucky you're in one piece.
STEVE

Yeah, I'm feeling luckier... by the

moment .
(he moves in)
You're from Guangdong.
KIM
I'm from Alameda.

STEVE
You're parents, then...
southern Canton.

KIM
How can you tell?

STEVE
Your Cantonese...has a provincial
dipthong. Que Ling?

KIM
You're close.

STEVE
Really!?

KIM

Yeah. They're from Oakland. Dad's a
systems analyst at Rockedyne. I'm as
American as Charlie Chan.

STEVE
But you speak Cantonese.

KIM
I yell it. That's all I know...
except for some curses on your ancestors,
bok gwei.

STEVE
I'm not a white ghost.

KIM
No, who are you then?

STEVE
Assistant curator at the Heritage
Museum.

KIM
I thought you were kidding.
STEVE
No... really. I...I was born in
Bejing. My father was teaching
there. I've been studying Chinese
Cc ure all my life. If the jade
piece I'm looking for is what I think it is,
our troubles are just beginning.

 

KIM
Our troubles...?

She laughs at this. SIRENS and LIGHTS up ahead. Cop cars
SCREECH. Glass BREAKING, cars CRASHING! BRAD runs up, hops
in the truck, starts it up.

Kim hands Steve
closes the door

BRAD
Come on, Kim. My contract
specifically states I don't
have to work during earthquakes,
atomic attacks, or civil
disturbances.

the broom, gets in the passenger seat. Steve
for her. She glances curiously at him.

KIM

What did you say you were?
STEVE

A... a collector.
KIM

Oh..? Of what?

STEVE
Beautiful things.

A beat. A moment between them. Imperceptibly, she smiles.

KIM
Well...I've gotta go.

STEVE
Joy Geen. (goodbye)

KIM
Yeah. See ya around.

Brad pops the clutch, squeals out.
21.

STEVE
Wait!

BRAD
Later!

Kim stares at Steve as Brad squeals away. A CLATTER! Steve
turns as Egg pulls down metal shutters on the shop.

STEVE
Wait! I want to talk to you.

EGG SHEN
Can't talk now. Good bye!

Egg slams the door, heavy bolts CRASH SHUT. Steve's left
alone, deserted in Little China.

CU - THE STOLEN JADE PIECE

CHI LUNG (V.0O.)
You've done well, my son.

INT. CHI LUNG'S WAREHOUSE - A FORTRESS HEADQUARTERS

Chi Lung admires the stolen JADE as Bobby looks on proudly.
Chi is ancient, powerful and dressed like a mandarin. His
room's furnished in exquisite art. He's evil, but witha
quirky, Alan Rickman/Jeremy Irons sense of humor.

Bobby's attitude has changed. He is uneasy before this
powerful sorcerer.

Bobby notes the frenzy with which Chi makes certain
incantations. He notices that Chi's entranced by the stolen

jade.

BOBBY
Thank you, boss. By the way...
this hunk of stone must be
pretty important to you, huh?

CHI LUNG
(very scary, threatening)
You are interested in the secrets
of my power?

BOBBY
Ahhh...no. No. Not really. Just
curious, that's all.

CHI LUNG
You wouldn't think of questioning my
authority...

BOBBY
Me? NOoooo....

CHI LUNG

Your loyalty to me is...

BOBBY
...uh..UNquestioned...Totally!

CHI LUNG
You were a lowly street hood and I
made you...
23.

BOBBY
Leader of the Flame Lords, your
magnificence, and I am deeply grateful.
It's just... well, we need... money.

CHI LUNG
(angry)
Money! You want money?!

BOBBY
You know... for expenses last night.
Gas, rope...tolls for the bridge...

CHI LUNG
(angry)
Money?! From me??

A FORCE BEAM shoots from Chi's palm, impales Bobby and lifts
him by the throat, levitating him, choking...

BOBBY
Ah...no. N-never mind. Forget it.
Sorry I mentioned it.
(Chi turns away. Bobby slams to the floor.)
Oooof! I mean, how do you do all this
neat evil stuff, anyway?

CHI LUNG
Oh, you know. The usual. Pact with
the devil. Knowledge that is power...
all that. But, with certain...
limitations. And you know how I hate
limitations!

BOBBY
Oh boy, do I!

CHI LUNG calls up images. Chinese ideograms appear.

CHI LUNG
That's why I've studied the ancient
texts.

BOBBY

The ones you had me steal?

CHI LUNG
Borrow. Short term loan. They've
revealed the CHAI TAO! The SECRET
MAGICAL ARTIFACT that will give me
ULTIMATE POWER!
24.

Bobby snatches the jade from Chi's hand.

BOBBY
That?...

Chi snatches it back. Light dims to just a highlight on Chi
and the jade.
CHI LUNG
This jade...One of the THREE PIECES
separated by YAMA, to prevent their
power from falling into...

BOBBY
(helpfully)
Evil hands?
Chi glares daggers at him.
CHI LUNG

Well, when I have the complete Chai
Tao, that won't matter, will it?

He opens a curtain revealing the golden statue of the god
Yama. He places the jade in the statue's outstretched hands.
An unearthly GONG RINGS. Bobby staggers, holding his ears.

BOBBY
What the hell is that!

CHI LUNG
Yes. As a matter of fact, Hell is
exactly what it is.

BOBBY
What?!

CHI LUNG
Yen Lo, Servant of Yama. I summon thee!

A THUNDERCLAP! Bobby grabs his ears and cowers. Chi looks
down with disdain. And unearthly HOWL. The statues SHUDDER!

BOBBY
Boss, you been dipping into the
Bok Fun again!
25.
CHI LUNG
Pay attention! I have...
(He whips out another piece from beneath his
robes.)

combined TWO PIECES of the
Chai Tao. The clock now starts.
We have 12 hours from the
time the TWO PIECES are combined...
to find and take possession of the
THIRD.

BOBBY
Or what? Wait a minute...Or what?!

CHI LUNG
A...slight penalty clause. If we fail
to find the third piece we will
be slaves of the demons of Hell for all

eternity.
BOBBY
Oh, is that all?
Huh? What do you mean... "we"?

BOBBY grows uneasy as...

S BOBBY'S POV

Statues around the room are changing, coming alive.

CHI LUNG
Besides I'm sure there's a
loophole. ..somewhere.
(glances at Bobby)
Something bothering you?

BOBBY
Uhh. ..Nothing..No... except
...Maybe...well, if I didn't know
better, I'd swear that
(points to a gargoyle)
that is...coming...to life!
(suddenly wants to depart)
Listen, don't pay me now. I'll just
put it on your tab.

Chi places a second JADE PIECE on the altar. They emanate
power. A RUMBLING HOWL FROM HELL! Gargoyles move.

Terrified, Bobby snatches ONE OF THE JADE PIECES, holds it up
before him like a protective talisman. Chi is outraged.
26.

CHI LUNG
What are you doing, you fool!
BOBBY
You never mentioned the part about
Hell.
CHI LUNG

Must've slipped my mind.

BOBBY
If this has power, maybe it'll
protect me.

CHI LUNG
Give me that, you twit!
(Bobby shrinks back)
Don't worry. You're with me!

BOBBY
Yeah sure! The guy about to go to
Hell. Great! Look, I want protection!

Bobby's demand triggers a change. The jade GLOWS. He drops
it, burning his hand. Chi snaps it up, hides it in the folds
of his robe. The room RUMBLES! Walls EXPLODE! In a burst of
radiance, Yen Lo arrives. And he is pissed!

The Servant of Yama confronts Chi. YEN LO is as big and scary
as Jack Palance on a bad hair day. He's dressed in blue
robes, a conical hat, with a silver serpent embroidered on
his chest. He looms over the others, intimidating...

YEN LO
Who commands me?

CHI LUNG
I, Chi Lung, have summoned you, Yen Lo,
servant of Yama!

He shows him the JADE PIECE set in the Yama statue. Yen is
shocked.

CHI LUNG
By this piece of the Chai Tao
I lay claim to all power over the universe!

YEN LO
One piece alone is not enough,
Chi Lung. You must now accompany
me to HELL... NOW!
27.

Chi Lung smatches THE JADE from the Altar and fits it with
the SECOND PIECE he whips out from beneath his robe. A FLASH!
Yen Lo is blown back into a dragon throne. The dragons come
alive, snake around and hold him fast.

CHI LUNG
You've grown careless, Yen. I have
not one...but two! I now make my
claim over the CHAI TAO, and when
YOU help me get the THIRD AND FINAL
PIECE, ultimate power wi be mine!

Yen Lo struggles mightily but the combined power of the two
artifacts traps him, holds him on the throne. Bobby's awed.

BOBBY
You can hold him there?

YEN LO
Not for long, Chi Lung. The judges
have been summoned.

BOBBY
Judges, what judges?

CHI LUNG
Oh, the ones from Hell. Now, I
really NEED the third piece.

YEN LO

You have just twelve hours!
BOBBY

Then what?
YEN LO

All Hell breaks loose.

(he laughs chillingly, then snaps to serious
threat...)

Twelve hours... to take possession of the
third piece.

Chi waves..-Thunder! Lightning! Flames and smoke break out.
The room ROCKS under the evil spell. Chi stands up to it.

CHI LUNG
Right. And we both know where it is.

EXT. EGG'S ANTIQUE SHOP - SAME TIME

Steve sweeps the last of the glass into the gutter, then
walks up to Egg's door. Egg's inside, bustling about.

He pulls down more shutters, draws shades, turns the "CLOSED"
sign. Steve holds up Egg's broom. Egg looks. After a beat, he
opens the door grabs the broom, tries to slam it again, but
Steve holds the door.

STEVE
Now can we talk?

EGG SHEN
Thank you. No.
STEVE
Why not?
EGG SHEN
Busy. Too busy. I have a tour to
conduct.

He nods toward a colorful TOUR BUS parked in the alley.

STEVE

A tour, good. I'ma student of Chinese
culture myself.

EGG SHEN
I'm busy...very busy.
STEVE
We need to talk about... this.

Steve holds up a picture of the stolen jade. Egg reacts. He
slips back inside the shop. Steve follows before he can close
the door on him.

Eh... well... we did.

Yes.

Chi Lung?

EGG SHEN
What do you know about this jade
piece?

STEVE

Lots. I know it's part of the Chai
Tao. A mystic puzzle that, according
to legend, holds the key to all the
power in the universe.

Myth! Superstition!

STREETS OF LITTLE CHINA - SAME TIME

A GAILY PAINTED TOURIST BUS rumbles down Grant Street.

INT. BUS

EGG SHEN lectures on Little China. The bus is painted in
Chinese motifs finished in red lacquer. Egg looks down the
streets, into alleys. He's distracted and lecturing half-
heartedly. Steve sits nearby and questions, much to Egg's
annoyance -- and to the mystification of the tourists.

EGG SHEN
.No. Chinese men were brought
over to work on the railroads. Women
followed later but the first
generations never really assimilated...

STEVE
Yeah, they brought their own beliefs,
their mystical priests, their magic.

EGG SHEN
Not true. Actually insulting to
Chinese. There are, of course, no
such things as demons, sorcery or
magic ...within the Chinese scheme
of beliefs. Chinese are very rational,
law-abiding...

STEVE
What about the Tong wars?

At this, Egg swerves the bus over to the curb in front of a
tea shop, opens the door, turns to the few tourist riders.

EGG SHEN
Rest stop. Five minutes. You go shop.
Very good tea.
They pile off. Egg turns to Steve, serious, now.

EGG SHEN
Tell me where you found the jade
piece.
STEVE
I found it. ...by accident... ...in the

vault. It was in the Fung collection.

EGG SHEN
Fung was a guardian!? I knew it!

STEVE
A guardian? What's that?

EGG SHEN
Nothing. Never mind.
(to himself)
Chi would not dare to steal this piece
unless he had one other. This is very
bad.
(catches himself)
Anyway...it’s all rumors, all myth.

STEVE
Maybe, but if it isn't, you might
be in danger. Why don't you let me
help you?

EGG SHEN
No...no. You do not need to get
involved. Thank you. Nothing personal...

STEVE
Everything's personal...

EXT. STREET

The tourists get back on the bus clutching packages as...

A LION DANCE approaches... Tumbling kids, streaming banners
Music and gongs. A golden paper Dragon-Lion weaves down the
street dancing, leaping, blocking traffic, blocking the bus
as the tourists climb back aboard and take seats. One lady
(ALMA) proudly shows off a souvenir.

ALMA
Look Ida. A piece of the great wall.

Steve looks askance...
34.

STEVE
The great wall...really! You sent them
there, Egg. You're a fraud!

EGG SHEN
Look. If you really had a piece of
the great wall would you sell it toa
woman in an “Elvis Lives" T-shirt?

STEVE
So... you give them what they want
to see -- and hide the real Chinatown...

the real magic.
Steve notices a picture of a Chinese kid taped to the dash.

STEVE
By the way... who's this?

EGG SHEN
Kok Leong. My Son.
(shakes his head sadly)
He's developing condos in Miami
Beach. Not so easy to find respect
for the old ways in the new
generation. Too many distractions.

ANGLE - BACK OF THE BUS

ALMA and her friend IDA look at the passing parade,
fascinated, clicking their Kodaks. The kid in the lion head
leaps on another's shoulders. He shakes and roars.

IDA
Oh look, Alma, a Lion Dance.
Isn't that cute...

The Lion leaps at the window. She raises her camera. The
lion’s mouth opens. She snaps a nice Close-Up of a fearsome
FLAME LORD. He SCREAMS at her.
FLAME LORD
Ng ho ying sheung! Bok gwei!
(Don't take photos, White Ghost!)
He smashes the window and grins madly.

IDA

She's gone rigid, too shocked to scream. Her companion hasn't
seen a thing. She turns to her.

What was that, Ida?

Then she notices Ida's face and the grinning Flame Lord.
She...SCREAMS!

INT. EGG'S BUS - MOMENTS LATER
Tourists sit terrified as lion dancers smash into the bus.

STEVE
So there's no current gang activity?

EGG SHEN
In Chinatown? Of course not.

Just as Egg says it, more Flame Lords burst from an alley and
sweep up the street, creating chaos. They overturn trashcans,
knock over cyclists. They leap at the bus, run up the sides,
dance on the roof. Tourists SCREAM! Doors burst open. Flame
Lords fly in.

EGG SHEN
It's nothing. Don't be alarmed.
Just a Lion Dance. All part of the
show.

BOBBY
(smashes a window)
A message from Chi Lung.

EGG SHEN
Flame Lords! Begone! You cannot
do this!

BOBBY

Wrong. This is just a start.

You have something Chi Lung wants.
And until he gets it, we take what
we want.

Egg slams it into gear, pops the clutch, sending Flame Lords
tumbling. Bobby's up, hopping over tourists. He leaps for
Egg. They struggle. Bobby yanks the wheel. The bus crashes
into a car. Passengers tumble. Flame Lords come forward.
Steve again takes a martial arts stance. They laugh, then
stop laughing and advance toward him.

BOBBY
No. You still ain't got it.
Look. It's like this.

He snaps into a Martial Arts stance. They surround Steve. Egg
Shen moves up, takes a stance next to Steve. He's old, but
something about him says ‘don't mess with me.'

Bok Sum! White Hearts!

It's a Call To Arms. It echoes through...
EXT. LITTLE CHINA

All along Grant Street, Street Lights in the form of CHINESE
LANTERNS GLOW...They PULSE BRIGHTLY...A MESSAGE.

MONTAGE - ALL OVER CHINATOWN

Kids note the flickering lanterns. They slip into alleys
storefronts, parked cars. They re-emerge wearing white
jackets with blue and green trim and matching headbands. They
are...THE WHITE HEARTS.

INT. THE BUS
Bobby moves on Egg, stalking, feinting attacks.

BOBBY
Give up the jade!

SUDDENLY - The White Hearts appear and engage the Flame
Lords. The leader's a good-looking youth: JACKSON "DOUBLE"
CHIN. He moves and fights so fast, he's a blur, (like seeing
double). All over the street, in the bus, on top of the
bus...White Hearts fight the Flame Lords to a standstill.
Then they drive them back. Then SIRENS, POLICE. Suddenly, the
Flame Lords' position is untenable. Steve faces off against
Bobby, but Bobby gives a sign... a challenge.

BOBBY
We'll meet again.

STEVE
I'm looking forward to it.

The Lords leap out the door, chased by the White Hearts. In
a wink, they're all gone.

Egg Shen slumps with an injured shoulder. He tries to turn
the wheel but can't. He winces in pain. Steve pulls him out
from behind the wheel, drags him to a seat.

EGG SHEN
What are you doing?
38.

STEVE
Just helping out.

EGG SHEN
No, thank you.

STEVE
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

In the back, some tourists are terrified.

TOURIST 1
What was that?!!

Some are irate.

TOURIST 2
What about our tour?

TOURIST 1
Yeah! We paid for a tour.

Steve glances at Egg Shen. He has a pained look on his face.

STEVE
Sorry folks, tour's over.

TOURIST 1
At least get us back to our hotel.

They look at Egg Shen. He hesitates.
STEVE
Look, I can drive. More or less.

Whadaya got to lose?

He slips into the driver's seat, starts up, grinding gears.

EGG SHEN
Hey kid!

STEVE
What?

EGG SHEN

Ever driven a bus before?

STEVE
Hey, how hard can it be?

CRASH! Steve looks outside.
STEVE
That car was already damaged.
It shouldn't count against me.

BOOOMM! He rips off the side of a parked car.

TOURIST 2
Oh, you can let us out here.

STEVE
Don't be silly. It's nothing.
No trouble at all.

Steve tries to pull out, but the tourists clamber off the
bus, leaving him with Egg.

STEVE
Now what was that you were saying
about the Chai Tao being a myth?

Egg slams the door.

EGG SHEN
How do you know such things?

STEVE
PHd. Asian Studies. Berkeley.

EGG SHEN
Oh...book learning!

STEVE
In the seventh century A.D.
in the Hsia (Sha) period of Mythical
Sages, the Court of Xuang Wa was
overrun by horsemen from the north.
The Imperial Wizard, Fu Hsi, inventor
of the eight trigrams, sacrificed the
most beautiful maidens in the Three
Kingdoms to the Hell God, Yama, Keeper
of the Gate...in return for a secret
power to keep the Barbarians at bay.
This power was contained in the Chai
Tao. As you know.

A beat. Egg's impressed, but dismissive.

EGG SHEN
Alright... so it was a good book.
But you still know nothing about the
real China.

39.
40.

STEVE
Why... because I'm not Chinese?

EGG SHEN
No. Because you are a Saw jai!
(young fool)

STEVE
If I am a Saw jai, you are a Lo
Saw See Fool! (foolish old man)
I'm offering you help...
And by the looks of things, you
could sure use some.

EGG SHEN
No. I don't need your help.

A BLAST OF THUNDER. LIGHTNING FLASHES, clouds let go.

STEVE
Sure about that?

INT. CHI LUNG'S FORTRESS - SAME TIME

LIGHTNING FLASHES SPARK around Chi Lung as he glares at the
Flame Lords straggling in...and at Bobby, empty-handed.

CHI LUNG
Where's the Jade?!
(Bobby shrugs helplessly)
What about Egg Shen?

BOBBY
He has what you might call, a bad
attitude.

CHI LUNG
So?itt!

BOBBY

There were White Hearts, and cops...
and some pain-in-the- butt Anglo guy.

CHI LUNG
Excuses! I ask for the Chai Tao. You
bring me excuses!

BOBBY
Well, we scared them some...
41.

CHI LUNG
Very good. The only way to control people
is through fear.
(then)
That gives me an idea...

He walks up to Yen Lo and stares. Yen Lo glares back.

CHI LUNG
Through Yen Lo, other demons can be
summoned and you, my Flame Lords...
will have the honor of serving as their
willing vessels...

There's muttering in the ranks. Chi turns to them, fixes them
with his glare.

FLAME LORD 1
Willing vessels ?! Geez, your worship...
I don't know...

CHI LUNG
Then shall Little China be brought
to its knees... and Egg Shen will
be forced to give up his jade!

FLAME LORD 2
But my Lord, I... I mean... if they...
if they inhabit our bodies, what
happens to us?

FLAME LORD 1
Yeah, what if we're not willing?

Chi's grin freezes. He levels a scary killer stare at the
miscreant. Then he claps his hands. Flame Lord One bursts
into flame, burns fiercely, turns to ash. A moment of stunned
Silence. The other Lords get the point.

FLAME LORD 2
Demons. That's not so bad.

CHI LUNG
You will have more power than you
ever dreamed of...

Chi Lung moves to Yen Lo.
YEN LO

You know the price for demons,
Chi Lung?
CHI LUNG
Yes, of course, virgins. Standard
price. One virgin for each demon.
I so demand!

BOBBY
What?

CHI LUNG

Find me 13 beautiful virgins!

BOBBY
In San Francisco?

Chi glares daggers at him, snaps his fingers. Bobby's hair
glows. Flames dance about his face. He's terrified.

BOBBY
Virgins. Right! Good idea.
Much prefer them, myself.

Bobby's becoming disillusioned. He notices a new
transformation in Chi. His features have distorted.

BOBBY
Are you okay, Wise One?

CHI LUNG
It's nothing....Hormone imbalance.
It makes me very...

Boom! A beam SHOOTS from his hands, levitates Bobby by a
terrible grip on his throat.

CHI LUNG (CONT'D.)
...irritable.

YEN LO
Very well. You asked for Demons!
Day Die Gwei Lei La!
(Hell God, come to me!)

He claps his hands. Around him Demons coalesce, swirl and
stream out, up, into..

INT. THRONE ROOM
One by one the Flame Lords are possessed. Their eyes glow

with fire, their tongues turn black, steam comes out of their
ears. They do a crazy, hip-hop demon dance.

CHI LUNG
Now...that's the spirit!

Bobby notices that he himself hasn't changed.

BOBBY
Hey Boss. What about me?

CHI LUNG
Mindless slaves are only so useful.
Your loyalty is unquestioned. Right?!

BOBBY

Oh, absolutely your worshipfulness.
CHI LUNG

Good. Now... DEMONS!!

They snap to attention.

CHI LUNG (CONT'D.)
Get those virgins while I make special
arrangements for Egg Shen. Demons...

BEGONE!
He makes a magical wave. The demonic Flame Lords disappear in
@ a burst of lightning.

EXT. STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO

Above Little China, clouds roll in, thunder and spiked
lightning... a Chinese Walpurgisnacht. The storm cloud seems
to hang directly over Chinatown like another dimension of
darkness, rain and mystery. Egg's bus zooms by the China
Gate. A police car pulls out and follows.

INT. POLICE CAR.

Egg's bus pulls into the alley. Egg hops out and scurries
off, distracted. He disappears into the back door of his
shop, Steve is suddenly left alone. Hesitantly, he follows.

INT. BACK OF EGG'S SHOP

What Steve sees amazes him. Everywhere he looks, books,
artifacts, objets d'art... It's a curator's wet dream. The
back of the store is a maze, a rabbit's warren of boxes and
shelves piled to the ceiling with (cheap props).

STEVE
Wow! Look at this stuff. Shen!
Mr. Egg! The Yut Lick Tung Sing!
The Chinese almanac; the T'ang
codex. Mr. Egg, can I have a word
with you?

Steve walks through the maze to the front of the shop,
fascinated. It too is filled with ancient, weird Chinese

things... dusty books, artifacts, curios of all types. But
messier... stuff tumbled all over. Then he looks up.
STEVE
Geeez! Egg... what a mess! You
really keep this stuff on the
floor?

Egg glares at him. Steve looks again. The shop's been
trashed!

EGG SHEN
Someone's been here.
45.

STEVE
Looking for something...looks
like...

EGG SHEN

Flame Lords.
Egg pushes Steve toward the door.

EGG SHEN
I don't have time for you.
Thank you. Goodbye.

STEVE
Goodbye?! No. Wait... you can't
do that!
(Egg turns back...)
I have some questions.

But Egg's distracted. He looks out at the gathering storm and
moves around the shop muttering to himself and gathering up
old dusty jars filled with strange powders and liquids.
EGG SHEN
No. It's dangerous. Too dangerous.
You must go.
Egg shoos him out and closes the shop.

END OF EGG'S STREET

Kim and Brad pull up in spooky darkness and flickering power
lines. One sparking line is attached to Egg's shop. All over
Chinatown lights flicker and flash.

BRAD
Jeez. It's dark!

KIM
Very observant. Come on.

She hops out but Brad is reluctant.

Electricity crackles from downed powerlines. All business,
Kim slips on a hardhat, a climbing belt. She gracefully and

powerfully scales the pole. Brad is spooked.

BRAD

KIM
Cut the power, Brad.

Brad opens up a manhole and slips down to cut the circuit.
EXT. EGG'S ANTIQUE SHOP

Steve stamds outside in the rain. Egg Shen can't believe it.
He goes to the door, arms full of magical elements, jars,
powders, potions... He's exasperated.

EGG SHEN
What do you think you're doing?

STEVE
Admit it. You're testing me.

EGG SHEN
Worse. I'm ignoring you.

STEVE
I saw it on Kung Fu. All the other
students ran off when it rained.
Grasshopper stayed where he was.

EGG SHEN
Grasshopper was an ACTOR!

Egg slams the door. Steve stands dripping in the rain. The
door opens.

EGG SHEN
Am I supposed to be impressed by
someone too dumb to get out of the
rain?

STEVE
Confucious says, “The journey of a
thousand miles starts with one step".

EGG SHEN
Confucius also said, ‘Get Lost!

He slams the door.
STEVE
That part must've been lost in

translation.

He jumps at a particularly vicious crash of lightning.

The lightning strikes the tops of buildings and ripples along

A DEMON LORD slams a crank. The cookie machine goes into
overdrive. Cookies fly out like tiny frisbees. Cooks flee
screaming as cookies whiz by their heads.

The Demon Lords fan out through Chinatown, yanking poor
helpless girls away from their screaming, frightened
families. They hold their demon features under cloaks and
hats...in shadow, barely but scarily glimpsed.

EXT. GRANT STREET

The Flame Lords run up to a family. One grabs a pretty girl.
They tear her away from her screaming parents, run off.

EXT. FONG STREET

Lords spot other pretty young girls. They rush up pushing
bystanders aside, grab them swing them on their cycles, ROAR
away.

Bobby, Yee and the demons run up to another girl, cowering.

grins, waves goodbye to Mei Li, leaving her parents
trembling.

Another bolt ripples down the building eaves, hits the pole,
knocks Kim off her perch. She dangles by her safety strap,
stunned.

EXT. STOREFRONT NOODLE SHOP

Steve comes out stufing an egg roll into his mouth. He looks
up, stops chewing.

HIS POV

St. Elmo's Fire ripples along the roofs and eaves of
Chinatown. It sparks and snakes down the powerlines to the
light poles, shorting them. Steve is awed. He reaches out,
touches the pole. The fire leaps to his hand, up his arm,
engulfs his body. His hair stands up with static charge.. He
stands hands out, entranced...glorying in the magic.

STEVE
It's real!
EXT. GRANT STREET - BELOW THE POWER POLE

Steve rushes up, sees the power truck, sees Kim on the pole.

STEVE
Hey Kim, you should see this.
Cold fire. Just like what was

He looks closer, sees Kim dangling. Without hesitation, he
leaps for the pole.

Brad calls her on the intercom but gets no answer. Curious.

BRAD

MONTAGE - ALL OVER CHINATOWN

Chinese lantern street lights come on, PULSE BRIGHTLY. Kids
note the call, slip into alleys, emerge as WHITE HEARTS.

ON THE POLE

Steve holds the stunned Kim, about to drop down when he sees
the FLAME LORDS standing below. Bobby grins up at him.

STEVE
Get away from us. Leave us
alone.

BOBBY
Or what?

He makes a mocking martial arts gesture. Just then, THE WHITE
HEARTS appear. They mix it up with the Lords but cannot
defeat these Kung-Fu Demons from Hell.

Steve carries Kim to the ground where Brad battles the Flame
Lords. The fight swirls around them. He carries her past Egg,
into the shop to safety. Brad throws the Flame Lords off,
scrambles to his truck, dives in, slams the door, locks it,
fumbles around for his keys as Demons beat on the sides.
ANGLE EGG

He directs the White Hearts with gestures.

YEN LO (O0.S.)
The jade, old man.

He turns as the LOOMING, POWERFULLY DEMONIC figure appears.

EGG SHEN
Yen Lo!!
51.

The White Hearts are stunned to discover that the DEMON FLAME
LORDS HAVE VANISHED. Egg turns away, runs into his shop.

INT. EGG'S ANTIQUITES SHOP
Egg enters. Yen Lo is already there, waiting, glowering.

YEN LO
Surrender the jade.
Chi Lung has so decreed.

EGG SHEN

(furious)
Chi Lung?! Chi Lung cannot decree
anything!

Chi Lung appears in a burst of flame glaring imperiously.

CHI LUNG
Not yet! Tell him, Yen Lo.

YEN LO
Chi Lung possesses two parts of
the Chai Tao.

Chi glowers. Yen Lo moves around the shop, examining a dusty
book here, an artifact there. He passes Steve and the semi-
consious Kim, hiding behind a desk. Steve pulls back to avoid
being seen but glances around the desk, fascinated...

EGG SHEN
Two?!! How did he get two??

CHI LUNG
I got the first from Chiang Kai Shek.
The second one’I got when some moron
put it on display in the museum.

Egg shoots a look at a very embarassed Steve.

YEN LO
(to Egg)
You must come with me.

EGG SHEN
Come with you? Where?

CHI LUNG
He wants to torture you. You
know how he is.
52.

EGG SHEN
Yah, love to. Actually, I've got
this dentist appointment..

Egg slides toward his shelf... toward ancient potions. Yen
moves to keep Egg's hands in sight. Egg stalls...

CHI LUNG
If I were you, Egg, I wouldn't waste
his time. It makes him very...cross!

A RIPPLE OF THUNDER. A FLASH.

CHI LUNG (CONT'D.)
If I don't get the THIRD PIECE right
now you... I ...I...will reduce
Chinatown to rubble!

Egg slips his hands toward his potions, but Chi spots the
move. A MAGICAL CHARGE from Chi Lung blows them out of his
reach. Egg turns on Chi... moves into fighting position.

EGG SHEN
It's been a long time, Chi.

CHI LUNG
Yes it has, Egg.

Egg grins, goes on guard. They circle. Yen drops his hand
like a referee. In a flash, Egg and Chi are mixing it, full
contact, full speed. Kicks, flips, twisters. Evenly matched,
fast as a blur. They fight.

EXT. WINDOW

Steve moves out to see. He cannot believe his eyes. A FLASH.
Chi's got his jade out. A FORCE BEAM BURSTS from it, but Egg
ducks, meets the beam with his own. He flips, kicks the jade
out of Chi's hand. The two pieces fly apart. One piece flies
to Yen who catches it. Chi scurries after the other piece,
grabs it. But Egg's in full control of his power. His beam
blasts Chi, blows him right through the window, hanging for
dear life onto his piece of the jade. Yen, holding his piece,
is also sucked into the vortex...and follows Chi out. Steve

is caught in the vortex by the powerful force... He grabs a
lightpole as he is whipped by, clings to it fora
beat....then is WHIPPED AWAY...

END ACT THREE

HOUR BREAK
53.

EXT. EGG'S SHOP

Egg and Kim rush out, catch a glimpse of Chi and Yen Lo
disappearing. They search the sky for Steve.

KIM
Steve!?

STEVE (0.S.)
Huhhh?

ANGLE - STEVE

He lies in a pile of trash, stunned, then he picks himself
up. Brad runs up.

BRAD
What the hell was that?
Those Flame Lords...Where'd
they go?

Egg turns and walks back inside. Steve rushes to follow.

STEVE
Wait!

Steve grabs Kim to support himself. They stumble back inside.
INT. SHOP

STEVE
Did you see that?

KIM
What?

BRAD
Two weird guys flying through
the air.

STEVE
Yeah, they burst out of here
and..just phfft! like that...
straight up

EGG SHEN
They will be back.
54.

Kim just stares at him. But Steve is concentrating. He goes
to a reference book Egg's left fallen open on the shelf. He
flips through rapidly searching... finding...

STEVE
Wait a minute I know that
guy! That was..
(finds an ancient picture...
an imposing figure in conical hat, robe
and silver chest serpent)
..-Yen Lo! Servant of Yama...
You know who that is?

KIM
You...are one strange Anglo.

Steve looks up, suddenly realizes...

STEVE
Where's Egg?

They turn around. No Egg Shen. The store seems deserted and
half destroyed in the fight. But Steve sees a glimmer of
light, a wisp of vapor from behind a shelf

KIM
What's going on?

STEVE
Yama. The Chai Tao. Have you
ever heard of Dai dei...
Chinese Hell?

KIM
Chinese Hell?
STEVE
Yeah...the ten levels?
KIM
Oh, yeah. Myths... Stories

my grandmother used to tell.

Steve studies the wall, then pulls open a Buddha to reveal a
passageway into a maze of boxes and shelf-lined corridors.

STEVE
Myths, huh?

Gestures toward the dark passage. A pause.
55.

KIM
After you.

They step through leaving Brad. Outside, demons howl. He
doesn't want to be left there. He steps through.

THE MAZE

It's dark and spooky. Dimly seen shapes. Brad tags along a
confused, scared look on his face. Kim and Steve creep
scrunched together, arguing.

KIM
(scornful, skeptical)
Sorcerers, guys flying through
the air..ten levels of Hell...

BRAD
What ten levels? Ten levels of
what?

KIM

The Ten Levels of Hell. Let's
see...you're put before some
mirror or something.

STEVE
The 'Mirror of Retribution'.
That's the first level.

KIM
Yeah, right.

STEVE
Your sins determine your form
upon reincarnation.

KIM
So, Brad. You'd come back as
a rabbit.
STEVE
Or a lazy soul might come back
as an ox.
She stops.
KIM
That's what Grandma Hong used
to say...

She looks at him with interest as he rattles on. But he's
searching through the boxes, examining objects and seems to
be following some unseen intellectual or spiritual trail...
STEVE
On the second level, the gossiper
has his tongue pierced.

KIM
The glutton is starved...

STEVE
The thief has to kneel on steel
granules.

KIM
(getting interested)
...the irreligious are sawed to
pieces, the wicked are boiled
in a cauldron...

BRAD
Whew! And I thought Catholicism
was tough!

STEVE
It gets worse. On the Third Level
of Hell, the disrespectful have
their hearts, eyes and livers torn
out. On the Fourth, the sinful are
thrown into a river of fire. Liars
get split lips.

BRAD
You must be a lotta laughs at
parties. Where are we, anyway?

IM
Isn't the Fifth where cheaters have
their hearts torn out with hooks.

BRAD
Hooks?

STEVE
Hooks. On the Sixth, thieves are
gnawed by rats.

KIM
On the Seventh, torn apart by dogs.
STEVE
On the Eighth, run over, made to
swallow burning oil... their

skulls smashed. You remember, now?

56.
57.

Kim is getting intrigued...despite herself. Suddenly, it's a
weird mantra... as if she's seducing him.

KIM
Yeah, and on the Ninth, addicts
are attacked by snakes and
dismembered.

STEVE
Yeah, I hate when that happens.
And in the Tenth court, final
judgement is passed.

KIM
Yeah...

Kim and Steve. A moment. A look. Interest. Brad's oblivious.

BRAD
Whew! And you guys believe all this?

Then the mood breaks. Kim is her rational self again.

KIM
It's as real as two little men
flying through the...

She gapes at what she sees up ahead.

KIM
What the... Egg... Egg?

KIM'S POV

Egg Shen is in a cul-de-sac, a shrine surrounded by magical
implements and weapons.

STEVE
He can't hear you. He's in the
Yum Lo trance. It's what a Spirit
Warrier does to prepare himself
before a battle.

Egg is in a trance and levitated a few inches off the floor.
Behind him THE THIRD CHAI TAO JADE glows softly in an altar
niche, emanating a glowing pulse...

INSIDE CHI LUNG'S FORTRESS HQ - SAME TIME
Yen Lo CRASHES through a skylight. The jade piece he had

grabbed skitters across the floor. Unsteadily he gets to his
feet, straightens his robes. He looks around.
58.

Chi Lung snatches the SECOND JADE PIECE off the floor and
» fits them back together. Now in control, Chi glares
furiously, his Flame Lords nearby.
YEN LO
You failed to get the third
piece. The old wizard is
stronger than you.

CHI LUNG
He won't be for long. I'm not
through yet.

At a gesture from Chi, Yen Lo is sucked to the dragon chair.
Dragons snake around him.

YEN LO
You have six hours left.
Then, I think I will bite the
top of your skull off and suck
out your lungs through your
spinal column.

INT. BACK OF EGG'S SHOP - THE MAZE - SAME TIME

Behind the levitated Egg, the THIRD PIECE OF THE CHAI TAO
e glows softly. Unable to stop himself, Steve moves up. He
touches the jade. A FLASH! Egg drops to the the floor.

EGG SHEN
Ooof!

STEVE
What's happened?

EGG SHEN
Chi Lung's got two pieces
of the Chai Tao. He's also got
just a few hours to get my piece
or go to Hell. He'll do anything
to get it. Even if it means
destroying Little China.
(turns to his work)
Leave me now.

BRAD
Good idea!

STEVE
Why don't you trust me? I
just want to help.
59.

EGG SHEN
(sarcastic)
You just want to learn the
magic.

STEVE
That too.

EGG SHEN
You can learn nothing unless
your heart is true.

Egg takes the jade, slips away... It's so fast, for a moment
they don't realize he's gone. Then Steve runs to catch up.

BRAD
Okaaaay! That pretty much
leaves us out of the picture.
Let's go.

He tries to lead Kim off. She doesn't move.

KIM
No. Wait.

BRAD
Wait! For what?

KIM
Nothing. I'm... I'm curious,
that's all.

BRAD
You don't believe in this
stuff, do you?

KIM
Magic? Course not.

She hurries after Egg and Steve.

BRAD
Hey...Wait!

Brad brings up the rear. Kim finds Steve. Egg scurries on
ahead. Steve has stopped to study an object.

STEVE
Chu'an do. Amazing.
KIM
» What's that?

STEVE
An ancient surgical instrument.
These people... your people...
were doing open heart surgery
four centuries before Christ.

KIM
Since when is a guy like you
so interested in Chinese
culture?

STEVE
Since I was a kid growing up
with my father in China.
The first image I can remember
is the Gum Lung ceremony.

KIM
The first image I can remember is
"The Flintstones”.

That breaks the spell.

e STEVE
Don't you wonder...? I mean,

we're so modern... so... arrogant.
But we have no idea of the beauty
of the ancient ways... of what
was lost over time. Of what the
real powers are...

KIM

You mean my grandma's stories?
STEVE

Not stories... but traditions. The

ancient rituals. The Myths. Even
today's China isn't China anymore.
There's even a fast food burger joint
across from the Forbidden City.

BRAD
You know, I'm hungry.

STEVE
...Only in certain areas...
well hidden... do the ancient
s live.

 
They have a moment.

Steve turns. Brad's there, frowning.

BRAD
Can we get on with this?
I’m starved. For me, eating
is an ancient mystery.

Kim glances at Steve.

Kim smiles, glances

INT. STORE

STEVE
The magic has left China. But
I think it's here...in Little China.
This jade...it's the key...proof
of the existence of ancient beliefs.

at Brad, then slips away.

Egg's busy. With mental powers alone, he repairs objects

broken in the fight
reassembles itself

Egg putters around

Pieces fly onto shelves, broken pottery
Kim's slips in. Her mouth drops open.

KIM
How did you...?

combining ingredients into spheres.

EGG SHEN
Magic perhaps.

KIM
You don't expect me to believe
that?

STEVE
You know what I think? That the
wise ones like Egg allow the ancient
secrets to fall into myth. The less
the public knows the better.

EGG SHEN
Yes... it's a constant struggle to
keep the ancient beliefs alive yet
secret... and to find young people
with the moral character to become
guardians of the CHAI TAO.

He looks intently at Kim. She turns away. Egg looks pensive.

STEVE
How about me? I could be a
guardian.
Egg considers then reaches around his neck. The CHAI TAO
piece dangles from a gold chain. Egg takes off his necklace,
steps forward. Steve grins -- thinking it's for him -- and
reaches for it. But Egg presents it to KIM.

KIM
What's this?

Kim looks at it. The colors ripple in her hand.

EGG SHEN
It... is meant for you.

KIM
It's beautiful...but...

EGG SHEN
If you are going to act so
recklessly you must carry it
at all times.

BRAD
Don't take it, Kim.
This is creepy!

KIM
No, I can't...

EGG SHEN
You must!...
(He's overstated something,
backs off, to save face.)
Please...

KIM
But why me? I'm American, not
Asian. I want nothing to do with
the old ways.

STEVE
You study martial arts.

KIM
For self-defense.

STEVE
But you saw Egg...

KIM
Ah...the light was bad.

Steve slips in next to her.
63.

STEVE
Take the piece. Take it.
It's the THIRD PIECE OF THE
CHAI TAO!

Kim knows something's going on, but doesn't know quite what.
And the piece is very beautiful. Egg grins.

KIM
Well... okay. Thank you.
EGG SHEN

No. Thank you.

Egg smiles enigmatically, slips away. Kim and Steve look at
each other and the jade for an awkward moment. It GLOWS and
PULSES. It SHIMMERS in her hand.

KIM
It's pretty... but magic
powers? I don't know.

STEVE
Then how do you explain
this...?

He tries a trick; touches the jade, rubs his hands, mumbles
incantations, spreads his palms. A flash. He staggers back.

BRAD
What was that?

STEVE
Holy cow! I almost had it
down.

KIM
(contemptuous)
That's it? The magic? You're
going to go up against “sorcerers”

..with that?
Egg returns, smiling...at Steve. He hold ancient texts.

EGG SHEN
He thinks he knows everything.

Egg makes a quick move, a glowing lotus blossom appears, then
aissolves into a golden mist.
64.

STEVE
How'd you do that?

EGG SHEN
You know the thing up here?
(indicates his head)
You must know it down here.

He indicates his heart.

STEVE
But I do.

EGG SHEN
You think you do. We shall
see.

Steve makes the same kind of gesture. A blossom starts to
appear. Then dissolves in a poof! Egg is slightly impressed.

STEVE
Now do you believe me?

EGG SHEN
No. But I do need all the help
I can get.

(He smiles. He's kidding. )
Come, grasshopper. We must prepare.

He zips through the maze, grabbing a vial here, a lacquer box
there. Steve hops to follow.

EGG SHEN
Lung quat; Dragon Bones. Fut show;
Buddha's Hand. Mow ngon; Cat's
Eye...And...tiger bile. Tannis
blossom. Lichee tea.

STEVE
Tea?

EGG SHEN
Replaces electrolytes lost
fighting demons. Some mandrake
root... corn starch for body.
Now mix it up.

Steve mixes it. Egg drinks. A TRANSFORMATION! He's no longer

a wizened old man,

but a powerful wizard.
65.

Egg turns to Kim. He offers the potion. She ignores it.
Steve sneaks a sip.

EGG SHEN
You deny your heritage?

KIM
My heritage? Subservience to men...
to the old ways?

EGG SHEN
Ahhhh...yes. You are overly
rational. Not a common failing
among women.

KIM
(irritated)
Thank you.

Steve just smiles at Kim...he feels the potion taking effect.
KIM (CONT'D.)

{to Steve)
What are you staring at?

  

Steve spreads his hands. A faint charge flickers between his
palms. Egg's intrigued. He points to a glowing incense coal
on his altar to his ancestors.

EGG SHEN
If you really believed...
one could pick it up in your
bare hands ...that is, if
you are truly worthy.

STEVE
And if not?

EGG SHEN
Oh, it'll burn the hell out
of you. You must have faith...
or a comprehensive health plan.

Egg looks at Steve critically, gauging his reaction.

Steve picks up the fiery ember. Egg's intrigued. Steve
glances at Kim, loses concentration, cries out, drops the

coal.
EGG SHEN

Of course, hot coals are a
problem for those with short
attention spans.
66.

Egg picks up the coal, pops it into his mouth, swallows it
He burps discreetly. A small flame bursts from his mouth.

EGG SHEN
Excuse me. See, not just faith
but heart. Otherwise all you'll
wind up with is heartburn.

Egg winks at Kim. He knows there is a growing attraction
between Steve and Kim. Brad senses it too.

BRAD
(testily)
Come on.

KIM
What?

BRAD
We gotta go.

KIM
Go?

BRAD
This is not our fight...
or whatever it is...
I mean, we have a job to do.

She looks at Steve.

STEVE
Oh, that's okay. I'll stay
and fight alone.

Kim turns, hesitates.
KIM

Alone? You two against all
the forces of Hell?

STEVE
That's alright. We can handle
it.

KIM

You couldn't handle a Kung Fu
move last time I looked.

STEVE
Thanks for your concern. Bye.
KIM
You don't think you need help?
You don't think he does?

BRAD
Come on. They don't need you.
KIM
They need me. They just won't
admit it.
BRAD

Yeah, well, what can you do?
A beat as she considers.

KIM
I'll stay. You go.

BRAD
Go? Where am I gonna go? You're
my partner, right?

KIM
Right.

BRAD
Even when you're wrong, right?

KIM
Like now, you mean?

BRAD
Right. I must be out of my mind,
but there's one thing I do know...
there's no such thing as magic.

Just then, a GIANT FLAME BALL bounds up the street and bursts
through the windows. The flaming ball roars at them. Steve
steps in front of Brad and Kim and catches it in his hands.

STEVE
No such thing as magic...
eh, Brad?

END ACT FOUR
68.

ACT FIVE

Steve stands holding the FLAME BALL. His hands FLAME.

A ghostly image of Chi Lung appears in the room.

CHI LUNG
Does it burn and sizzle?!

STEVE
No. I like to do this.

CHI LUNG
Give me the third piece of
the Chai Tao or...

The FLAMES ROAR. So does Steve.

EGG
Mind over matter. Mind over
matter!

STEVE
Do you mind? It's my matter.

KIM
Help him!

EGG SHEN
You must treat the bad magic
with contempt.
{turns to Kim)
You must also believe...

KIM
Me?

EGG SHEN
Yes. It couldn't hurt.

Kim closes her eyes, concentrates. The jade GLOWS.

EGG SHEN
(to Steve)
Relate it to something real.

STEVE
Something real? The last time I was
holding a ball of fire. Let's see...
it was my birthday cake. I made a wish.
EGG SHEN

Make it now. You can do it!
STEVE

T can't.
KIM

Make a wish!!

This gets him. A look of determination crosses his face.
Steve stares at his hands burning fiercely.

He takes a deep breath and blows with all his might. The
flame flickers out. Chi's gone. Egg's pleasantly surprised.

EGG SHEN
Very good, grasshopper.

KIM
What did you wish for?

STEVE
Train set. Same as always.

EGG SHEN
Well, whatever it was, it worked.
I'm proud of you.

STEVE
You mean that?

EGG SHEN
Yeah, proud as any inscrutable
person can be. There may be hope
for you two yet.

KIM
What are you talking about?

EGG SHEN
Yin and Yang. Man and woman.
Each incomplete without the
other. But when they come together,
BAM!
(He punctuates with a tiny explosion.)
You are not one of us, but...
you have something. Here... the
ancient texts. Maybe if you two
work together...

They glance at each other awkwardly.
70.

STEVE
Nothing personal... It...
it would just be magic.

KIM
(laughs)
Yeah...sure.

At Egg's gesture the walls open up to reveal a LABORATORY

with potions, flasks, distilling apparatus, magic swords,

armor... a distillery and armory of magic. He gathers the
Magic Spheres seen earlier.

EGG SHEN
You've heard of Aladdin's lamp.
Well, same thing. The holder of
the complete Chai Tao can ask a wish.
Chi Lung will ask for ultimate power
for evil.

BRAD
Oh... is that all.

Steve's beside himself with excitement. He runs his hands
over the books. Then he notices the White Hearts appear.
Double Chin looks alert, on guard.

EGG SHEN
It's okay, they're with us.

Double relaxes a touch...studies Kim, Brad, Steve. A SUDDEN
EXPLOSION. The room rattles..Dust sifts down.

DOUBLE CHIN
Egg, you better help us.
The Flame Lords are tearing
the city apart!
Suddenly, there's a ruckus outside. They rush to the window.

EXT. GRANT STREET

Flame Lords rush up. Citizens try to fight back, but they are
no match for the Flame Lords. SCREAMS!

DOUBLE CHIN
White Hearts. Come On!

They rush out. Kim follows...
EGG SHEN
No. Wait! Wait for the magic!
He just doesn't listen...
Come on!

Egg frantically stuffs the Magic Spheres into a pouch.
EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

The White Hearts give chase, followed by Kim, then Brad and
Steve. Egg brings up the rear lugging the pouch.

BLIND ALLEY

The Flame Lords rush in and disappear. The White Hearts
follow... then look around... uneasy.

DOUBLE CHIN
They're gone. What do we do?

BOBBY (O.S.)
Prepare to Die!

A MAGICAL IMAGE SHIFT (OR A CHEAP DISSOLVE)

The empty alley is filled with Bobby and the Flame Lords
demonstrating demonic powers, nasty weapons and bad
attitudes. They surround and move in to attack. The Hearts
are rushed from all sides.

EGG SHEN

rushes up with his pouch of magic. He rolls the spheres at
the Flame Lords... They burst into shrapnel.

KIM AND BRAD

fight valiantly, twisting, kicking, leaping. Even Double is
impressed. But the Demonic Lords are too much. The White
Hearts are driven back.

A RUSH. The Demons focus on Kim, grab her and drag her off.
Brad lunges for her, but comes up with just the JADE
NECKLACE. A Flame Lord tumbles him into a corner.

EGG
battles madly, but there are too many. They rush him. He

disappears in a pile of writhing demons. His pouch drops. One
final sphere tumbles out.
STEVE

makes a grab for the last of the exploding spheres. It rolls
towards a sewer grating...

Steve dives for the sphere. Just as it drops into the sewer,
he intercepts it, tosses it blindly in the Flame Lords'
direction. It EXPLODES!

ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

The dust clears. The demons are gone. So are Egg and Kim.
Steve helps Brad up and notices the necklace.

CU - THE JADE
It glows and throbs powerfully.
ANGLE - STEVE AND BRAD
They walk off quickly into the dark, spooky night.
ANGLE - STEVE AND BRAD - TRAVELING
Steve's entranced by the jade. Brad is freaking out!
BRAD
Jeeshhh! Truck's trashed!
Kim's gone. Hey, those were
some scary demons! Demons?!
My god!
STEVE
They took Egg. We gotta find
him. And Kim.
BRAD
Yeah, Kim... I hope she's

alright. Hey, how am I gonna
explain this to the company?

STEVE
Do you understand? they kidnapped
Kim!

BRAD

Yeah, Boy, I hope those demons
know what they're doing. They get
on the wrong side of her, they'll
wish they'd never been born...

or whatever demons are.
~

w

They turn into another blind alley and stop. Too late.

STEVE
You wonder why they took them
and not us?

BRAD
Should we be insulted?

STEVE
It must be the jade.

BRAD
What jade? You mean this?

Brad reaches for the jade just as four Flame Lords drop down
from above. One snatches the jade from Brad and holds it up
triumphantly. Steve snatches it back and runs.

A CHASE

Through alleys, tunnels, passages. Steve scampers ahead.
The jade holds them off.

CUL-DE-SAC

Steve breaks into an open area lit by a trashcan fire that
throws scary shadows on the walls. One shadow's a demon. It
grabs for Steve. He ducks but Brad is caught, dragged off.

BRAD
No. Lemme go! You can't do
this. I'm in the union!

STEVE

turns back to help. He's jumped. They fight. Steve's out-
numbered. A Demon stuffs Steve head-first into a trashcan.
The demonic Lord steps back, pleased with his work.

STEVE
Chai tao sun! Bong ngor!
(Puzzle God, help me!)

A BOLT shoots out of the can, enveloping the demon. Steve's
BLOWN OUT, spinning.

IN MIDAIR
He rights himself, holds the jade out before him. He lands

softly, amazing himself as much as the demons. He's singed
but okay. He unclenches his fist, notices...
74.

cu - STEVE HAND
The jade has left a burning imprint.
STEVE
STEVE
Ayee yaa! Jun Bong do ngor!

(Wow, he really did help me!)

The Lord's now just a pile of smoking ash. Steve's alone. He
studies the jade curiously. It changes color.

STEVE
Jeezzz. I got ‘em, Brad.
(he looks around)
Brad?... Where are you?

Steve stands in the alley... alone.

END ACT FIVE
CT SI

INT. CHI LUNG'S FORTRESS - DUNGEON - SHORT TIME LATER

Egg and Kim are imprisoned along with a number of sobbing,
young girls. Brad is carried in and dumped on his head.

BRAD
Ooof! Hey, I believe you've
just violated my civil rights.
You're in big trouble now!

The demon LUNGES AND ROARS at him. It curls Brad's hair. He
rapidly scrambles backward, away.

BRAD
And do something about
your breath.
He catches sight of Egg.
BRAD
Whew! These guys are kinda
lax in personal hygiene.

He spots Kim.

BRAD
Kim...there you are...

He looks around.

BRAD
Kim. Where the hell are we?

She looks at Egg.

EGG SHEN
Not exactly Hell... but close.

Egg is calm as a Buddha, but Kim is seething.

KIM
How can you sit there so
calmly?!

BRAD

What's wrong?
76.

KIM
What's wrong?! We've been
captured by demons, imprisoned
with a bunch of whining...
young. ..virgins.

BRAD
Yeah...
(eyeing the virgins)
virgins.

KIM
And you... Great Wizard!
Why don't you do something!

Egg looks up from his meditation.

EGG SHEN
Why don't you!

KIM
Me?

EGG SHEN
Trust the Chai Tao.

KIM
Iocan't...I'm not...

EGG SHEN
You must! Chi Lung has to
face the Judges of Hell. He
doesn't have the complete puzzle.
He'll stall ... maybe offer them
virgin sacrifices for more demons.
And to keep them amused.

BRAD
Yep. That would do it for me.

KIM
Sacrifices? Human sacrifices!?

EGG SHEN
I'm afraid so.
BRAD
Wow! Good thing I'm not a
virgin.
(Kim glances at him)
What are you so mad about?
You're off the hook, aren't
you?

Kim stares at Brad for a beat.

KIM
Well... we can't do anything
here. Let's find a way out.

EGG SHEN
There is no way out.
KIM
There's gotta be...
She walks toward a doorway... BLLLZZZT! She's blown back.
EGG SHEN

For the first time,

The mystic bands are too
strong.

KIM
You're a top wizard! Why don't
you do something?

EGG SHEN
You must do it. You must use
the Chai Tao.
(She stares at him.)
...the jade.

KIM
This...?
(reaches for her necklace)
It's gone.

EGG SHEN
Gone?! What do you mean?

KIM
I mean I don't have it anymore.

he shows fear.

EGG SHEN
Then, we are in Big Trouble.

a
my
BRAD
I could'a told ya that!

KIM
{starts to panic)
I must've lost it during the
fight.

EGG SHEN
Well the Flame Lords don’t
have it.

BRAD
Steve had it. But the last I
saw of him, they had him over
a barrel.

EGG SHEN
(suddenly hopeful)
But he's not here. He's not captured.
Maybe he does have it.

 

SUDDENLY, A RATTLING ROAR. Chi's LAUGHTER is HEARD. The walls
SHAKE, start to DISSOLVE.

EGG SHEN (CONT'D.)

.I revealed the ancient ways
to him. If he evaded the Flame
Lords Steve must have the magic
well in hand.

EXT. EGG'S SHOP - SAME TIME
A MASSIVE EXPLOSION blows out what's left of the windows.
INT. EGG'S SHOP

Steve sits at the counter, blackened face, shards of a flask
in his hand. He looks up at Double Chin.

STEVE
Too much Ni-Chi!. I'll just
add some Yun-sum root.

Double Chin's unsure. Steve's too excited to be intimidated.
He busily mixes potions from Egg's magical ingredients.

DOUBLE CHIN
Err... what exactly did Egg
say to you?
79.

STEVE
Uh, you know... the magic...
it's really a simple thing if
you follow the formulas. Of
course, you have to believe,
have faith and all that.

DOUBLE CHIN
Did he say anything about talent?
..-You know, a feel for the thing?

Steve adds a powder. A small BLAST rattles the windows.

DOUBLE CHIN (CONT'D.)
Did he mention liability
insurance?

STEVE
I'm gonna take all this stuff
and go and get him and Kim...
Maybe Brad.

DOUBLE CHIN
You?! Against Chi Lung?! You're
just gonna walk in?

STEVE
No, I'll take the bus.

DOUBLE CHIN
You're crazy!
(to White Hearts)
Come on, Hearts, let's go.
We'll take care of this ourselves!

They turn, march out.

EXT. CURIO SHOP

They emerge to find Steve standing there. Stunned, they turn
back to shop and see Steve also standing inside.

BACK TO EXT.

The outside Steve raises his hands parallel to each other.
Electricity dances between them.

DOUBLE CHIN
How'd you know how to do that?
STEVE
Oh, the Mau Soot! ...the
"Two places, One Time”?
It's nothing. Ancient hat
trick.

The White Hearts look at each other.

STEVE
They got demons, they got most
of the Chai Tao. They got Egg
Shen. I think you guys can use
all the help you can get.

He creates a hologram of the jade. It shimmers before them.

DOUBLE CHIN
You've learned the magic...

STEVE
Yeah. And I've made more of
Egg's potion. I think it'll
enhance strength and speed.
At least that's what it says
in the book, here.

They look uneasy. He offers it. It bubbles from flask to
glass and foams toxically.

STEVE
Go ahead. The first one's
always free.

DOUBLE CHIN
(excessively polite)
Oh, no. You first.
Then Steve's not so sure. He screws up his courage and
swallows it. He drinks, stands blinking and burping.

DOUBLE CHIN
How d'you feel?

STEVE
Strong as an ox.
(sniff, sniff)
...Same fragrance. Care for
a sharpener?

He offers the foaming cup. They back away.
At the dare.

Double

STEVE
You want to grow big and
strong like the demons, don't
you?

DOUBLE CHIN
How can you know of this?

STEVE
I'm a quick study.

DOUBLE CHIN
No. It's impossible for you
to lead us, to learn the magic,
the ancient ways... Only Egg Shen
can know these things.

STEVE
Oh?
(flips, lands in the same
place, TWANGS with energy.)
Well, maybe it's because my
heart is pure.
(A flask blows, showering
them with shrapnel.)
Then again, maybe not. Maybe
I need the jade. Well, you want
to have a stranger to save your
master? Alone? Against all the
forces of Hell? Well? Do ya?

grabs the potion, takes it in a gulp.

STEVE
Well...

DOUBLE CHIN
I think I...feel...something.
Hey, I feel great!

STEVE
That's just the caffeine.
Can you move really fast?

DOUBLE CHIN
How's that?

STEVE
How's what?

DOUBLE CHIN
See, really fast.
82.

Steve rolls his eyes, but Double turns and high-fives him,
making a mild thunderclap.

DOUBLE CHIN
Haiiii Loh! Fat seut do!
(Yes, Magical powers! Victory!)
He flips, spins, tumbles, darts around the room at incredible
speed. The White Hearts are clearly seeing double. He's a
blur. Then he appears in a flash.

DOUBLE CHIN
What do you think?

STEVE
Looks like happy hour at
the espresso bar. Who's next?
The White Hearts line up, grab cups.
STEVE
Potion, potionccino,
or potion latte?

They take the cups, look at each other.

DOUBLE CHIN
Yuan ho! (Salute!)

They ceremonially drink as one. They gulp, smack their lips.
A beat. A BLUR as they flip around the room at double speed.

EXT. LITTLE CHINA - LATER THAT NIGHT
EGG SHEN'S BUS creeps through the darkened streets.
INT. BUS

Steve and the Hearts are wired and jabbering like magpies.
Double Chin notices the sky above the warehouse.

DOUBLE CHIN
Shhhhh... Uh oh!

EXT. LITTLE CHINA

The sky boils with swirled lightning and dark clouds.

w

INT. DUNGEON - CHI'S FORTRESS - MID DISSOLVE

into Chi Lung's Throne Room. Egg, Kim and Brad and the
virgins are transported by Chi's magic and materialize.
Chi's more demonic than ever. He grins at the terrified
girls, at Egg and Kim.

CHI LUNG
Ahhh... the thirteen beautiful
virgins.

BOBBY

Yeah, practically every one
in the Bay Area.

CHI LUNG
But WHERE IS THE JADE!

BOBBY
The jade?

A FORCE BEAM shoots from his hand, grabs Bobby by the throat,
lifts him off the ground.

CHI LUNG
(furious)
I told you to get the final piece
of the Chai Tao from Egg Shen!
Time's running out!

BOBBY
He doesn't have it. We looked
all over, took his shop apart.

CHI LUNG
You... you coward! You traitor!

His force field slams Bobby up against the ceiling. Chi
releases him, he drops to the floor.

BOBBY
Oooof!

Overcome with fury, Chi moves on Egg Shen.

CHI LUNG
Where's the jade, Egg Shen?

EGG SHEN
With a worthy mortal.
84.

CHI LUNG
I will HAVE THAT JADE!

Force beams fly from his hands slamming them all high up on
the walls!

CHI LUNG
I can't believe it! Henchmen,
Demons...Black Magical Powers!
(SCREAMS to the heavens!)
Is there no one who will BRING ME
THE JADE?!

EXT. CHI LUNG'S FORTRESS - SAME TIME

The bus idles as the White Hearts survey the perimeter.
The JADE NECKLACE dangles from Steve's neck.

DOUBLE CHIN
Well?

Double is apprehensive. Other White Hearts report.

WHITE HEART
Reinforced gate. Tripwires,
interrupter beams. Motion
sensors...possibly gas.

DOUBLE CHIN
(turns to Steve)
What do you think?

STEVE
I think this calls for something
elegant

DOUBLE CHIN
Right. Like what?

INT. FORTRESS

Flame Lords stand guard. Suddenly, THE DOOR SHATTERS,
sending them flying. The bus ROCKETS through, filled with
screaming White Hearts, SLAMS into a wall and comes to rest
steaming. Double shakes his head.

DOUBLE CHIN
That... was e ant?
STEVE
I thought so. You know...
in terms of simplicity.

INT. FORTRESS / EXT. BUS

The Demon Lords are down but not out. They swarm as the White
Hearts tumble off the bus. The battle's joined.

It's demon versus potion, magic against magic. The demons
are horrific and terrifying, slashing the air with their
razor claws. The White Hearts are so quick the demons can't
nail them, can't land a blow. The White Hearts are flipping
overhead. They're everywhere.

Double Chin flips to get out of a jam and lands in a cache of
firecrackers. He rubs them together at super speed, springs
out just as they go off in a Technicolor BLAST!.

White Hearts fall upon the demons. The White Hearts
penetrate further into the hidden domain. Then... the Demon
Lords back away. Double warns...

DOUBLE CHIN
No! Wait! Hold up!

Too Late! The trap is sprung. The walls DISSOLVE and they
are in..

INT. THRONE ROOM

Chi Lung's LAUGHTER RINGS IN TRIUMPH!

END ACT SIX
86.

ACT SEVEN

INT. CHI'S FORTRESS - THRONE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Chi cackles in triumph as the Flame Lords get to their feet,
licking their wounds. A FLASH! A BURST OF PLASMA -- shooting
from Chi‘s JADE PIECES -- coalesces as an ENERGY BALL in the
middle of the room. Chi Lung's LAUGHTER stops as, with a
BOOMING ROAR, the JUDGES OF HELL appear. If you thought Yen
Lo was bad, these guys are worse! Snarling, bad-tempered
Demon Monsters, each scarier than the other. They glare at
Chi with ill-concealed contempt. He puts on a happy face.

CHI LUNG
(mumbles to himself)
..-not quite ready...
(then to the judges)
Judges of Hell...Welcome!

The FIRST JUDGE just SNARLS. Chi's smile freezes. He turns
to JUDGE TWO, who is busy MORPHING into something even more
menacing.

CHI LUNG
Yah, well... Okay then, right
to business! Presenting...

He spreads his arms like a Master of Ceremonies. The lights
go up, revealing the whole of Chi's work: Thirteen altars
appear in a circle. On the altars the sobbing virgins are
bound. Among them, shackled to the wall, are Kim, Bobby, Egg
and Brad. And, in a GOLDEN HOLDING PEN with AN ELABORATE
MAGICAL LOCK, Steve, Double and the White Hearts... and
dangling from Steve's neck, the JADE.

CU - STEVE - THE JADE
He quickly stuffs it under his shirt before anybody sees.
ANGLE - THE WALL

KIM
What's all this?

BOBBY
The virgins? Oh, sacrifices.
Down payments on the demons.

KIM
Yeah, so what are we doing here?
BOBBY
Kind of an honorary thing.
You know, you could save
yourself, come to the dark
side with me.

KIM
I - I don't think so. I don't
look good in red and black.
And you better watch out for
yourself. I think he's crazy.

BOBBY
Yeah, well...I was starting
to notice that.

He stops as he notices Chi getting more demonically
grotesque.

KIM
Look! He isn't even human
anymore. You think he'll let
you live when this is over?

BOBBY
(shocked at the thought)
He'd never...

KIM
Oh, yeah? Look at your friends.

More Flame Lords stumble in. One is badly wounded and
GROANING. Annoyed, Chi Lung turns, lofts a PLASMIC BLAST,
BLOWS HIM AWAY. Clumps of demon fur float to the floor.

ANGLE - CHI LUNG
He glares at the smoking spot, turns back to his guests.
CHI LUNG
Ahem...Now, the sacrifice
will please come to order.
GONGS RING. Demons come to attention. The ceremony begins.

Chi Lung goes to the first young woman, putting his hands on
her shoulders. She struggles in horror.
88

CHI LUNG
It's alright. It's not even
death as we know it. Just the
temporary use of your soul.
Hardly miss it. Trust me, I know.

With glowing eyes, the evil sorcerer starts to pull the
girl's soul right out of her body. Her eyes bulge... green
mist drifts out and curls about her head. She struggles and
pulls it back.

CHI LUNG
That's right, don't make
it too easy.

He leans in, his eyes glow red, his face morphs into a
horrible monster. The Virgin opens her mouth to scream.

With a SUCKING SOUND her soul exits her mouth as a column of
pale green smoke. The girl's soul becomes a bright sphere
that floats above her empty head.

CHI LUNG
See, if women would just learn
to keep their mouths shut.

ANGLE - KIM

KIM
(outraged)
You... Geu! (pig)

Chi Lung turns his awful attention on her. She and Bobby
freeze. Chi glares. He takes an interest and moves to her.

CHI LUNG
And who is this?

BOBBY
Ummm, extra added attraction.
Kim Fan of the Power Company.

KIM
That's Ms. Kim Fan to you!

Chi is pleasantly surprised.

CHI LUNG
Oh, yes. One of Egg Shen's
little proteges. Perhaps,
also... a quardian of the jade?
89.

KIM
I don't have the jade.

Chi turns to Bobby, glaring...

CHI LUNG
Did you check?

BOBBY
What are we wasting our time
for... it's not here, boss.

He moves to Kim, grinning. ROAR! Bobby's lifted ina
PLASMIC BEAM. He flames for a bit, then drops.

CHI LUNG
Of course it's here, you idiot!!
I can feel its presence!
Bring the girl to me!

BOBBY

Sprawled on the floor, gets wobbily to his feet. He moves to
Kim.

BOBBY
(mumbles to himself)
I'm an idiot. You're the one
going to hell.

ANGLE - KIM AND BOBBY
Bobby unshackles her.

KIM
He's a monster!

BOBBY
This is nothing. You should see
when he really loses it.

KIM
(moves to Bobby)
You're better than this.
You don't belong with him.

BOBBY
You really think so?
(A beat.)

Well, I certainly didn't count
on this Hell stuff.
90.

ANGLE - STEVE

STEVE
(loudly)
You know, you guy's are really
Starting to get on my nerves.

Chi looks over, BLASTS STEVE. He rolls across the pen toward
Brad.

BRAD
What did you do that for?
STEVE
I'm trying to get us all out
of here.
BRAD
So far you're doing a great
job..

Steve notices Egg, still pinned on the wall.

STEVE
Egg!! Can you help us?!

EGG SHEN
Not while I'm held here.
Not while the jade's lost.

STEVE
It's not lost. I got it
right here.

He holds up the THIRD PIECE OF JADE
MATCH DISSOLVE

CU - THRONE

Chi sets the other pieces in an altar. He makes incantations.
The girls' souls drift above their bodies. Bobby brings a
struggling Kim towards Chi.

ANGLE - CEREMONY

All attention is on the girls' souls. They drift toward the
Judges. The Judges look interested.

CHI LUNG
I promised you virgins,
I gave you virgins...
CHI LUNG (CONT'D.)
And now... I offer you
a bonus.

He moves towards Kim. She is clearly not excited about this.

CHI LUNG (CONT'D.)
(to Judges)
Do we have a deal?

JUDGE
We make no deals, Chi Lung.

ANGLE - KIM AND BOBBY
She works on him.

KIM
You think he's going to show
any loyalty to you?

ANGLE - CHI LUNG - BEFORE THE JUDGES

CHI LUNG
Not so easy to find beauty
like this in Hell. Quite a prize.
Think about it.

Chi's grown uglier, demon-like...hellish.

YEN LO
Do not toy with us, Chi Lung.
You have a debt to pay...
and your time is running out.

ANGLE - THE GOLDEN PEN WITH ELABORATE MAGICAL LOCK
interwoven with scrolls and icons, dragons, and idiograms.

Using his knowledge of Chinese artifacts, Steve tries to
figure out the magical unlocking formula.

STEVE
If I can just figure out
these symbols... I might be
able to find a way to free us.
EGG SHEN
Don't try it. They'll
kill you.
STEVE

I didn't think you cared.
A HOWL from the demonic judges of Hell, 0.S.

EGG SHEN
Well, whatever you're going
to do... Do it fast.

STEVE
There are symbols... and then
there are symbols.

EGG SHEN
And you went to college for
that?

The demonic judges move in, ROARING, HISSING, CLAWING.

STEVE
What am I missing?

EGG SHEN
You must find the answer for
yourself.

BRAD
That's it!? You got us all into
this!! And now you're quoting

"The Wizard of Oz"?!

STEVE
That's it!! The power is
in my hands. I've had it all
along. The jade!!

EGG SHEN
Now you're catching on,
grasshopper.

Steve holds the jade to the lock.

EGG SHEN
But you cannot do it alone.

STEVE
(shouting)
Kim!! Help me!

The demonic Chi Lung snarles. He approaches Steve.
CHI LUNG

So you have the jade!! Give
it to me or you will all die!!
KIM
{to Steve)
What can I do?

STEVE
Come on. Remember that phrase
your grandmother taught you...

KIM
I remember. Of course I
remember.

EGG SHEN
But you must also believe...

KIM
Believe... I do believe... I believe...
(demons are moving in)
I believe I'm in Big Trouble!

STEVE
Chai tao sun...do!
(Puzzle God...come!)

Kim breaks free of Bobby. She runs to the golden cage and
reaches through the carved lock. Her finger barely touches
the jade...

KIM
Chai tao sun, bong ngor!...
(Puzzle God, help me!)

BOTH
Yut chai ho hup!
(United in harmony!)

The JADE FLASHES! The GATE flies open. A ROAR OF FIRE.
The White Hearts tumble out. Flame Lords rush to meet them.

ANGLE - THE THRONE - SAME TIME

Chi Lung has completed his change... He's been transformed
into an ogre. He turns on them. FLAME balls spew from his
hands, his eyes, his mouth...

BOBBY

He's terrified. In a flash, he grabs Steve's jade and holds
it up.

BOBBY
Here, Chi Lung. I have
the jade!
94.

He holds it up. Chi sends out a BOLT and grabs it, but Bobby
hangs on and is carried over to the altar. He drops. Chi
glares at him, eyes burning.

BOBBY
Let them go! Chi Lung!
You've got what you want.

Chi opens his hand for the jade. Bobby's compelled to
release it. Chi grabs the THIRD JADE PIECE, knocks Bobby
aside,... and puts all the pieces togeth...

STEVE
No!

Steve leaps at Chi Lung and knocks the jade puzzle apart! The
three pieces fly off in different directions. Chi sends a
FIREBALL BLASTING at Steve. He's knocked down, tumbled under
the blast. The Flame Lords attack. Double Chin and the
White Hearts take them on.

ANGLE - CHI

He throws a BOLT down at the three pieces of jade. They slide
across the floor, inexorably drawn back toward Chi Lung.

THE CHAI TAO

Steve grabs for one piece. He's dragged by it under and
through the tumbling combatants.

KIM
leaps for the second piece and gets dragged, kicking...
BOBBY

grabs the THIRD PIECE. He is dragged toward Steve and Kim.
In a few seconds, the Chai Tao will be complete.

KIM
Bobby... NO!! Don't let
it happen! !

Chi Lung turns his power on Kim. He scorches her with a
blast of lightning. She screams in pain.

BOBBY
No, Chi Lung!! Let her
alone!!
95.

CHI LUNG
NO??!! You worthless toad! !
When I am the Lord of the
Universe, I will rid myself
of you and your pathetic
jabbering.

Bobby has had enough. He digs in his heels trying not to let
the pieces come together but, inch by inch, he's drawn in...

BOBBY
No!

CHI LUNG
(shocked)
No?i!

Bobby heaves his jade toward Steve. It hits and slides.
Everyone dives for it. Steve gets there first.

CHI

is furious! A magic sword appears. He SLASHES though Bobby.
Blood spatters onto the field that imprisons Yen Lo.

STEVE

slams the two jade pieces together.

CU - THE JADE PIECES

...COME TOGETHER. POOF! A MASSIVE EXPLOSION!

Yen Lo appears full-sized and disgruntled. He waves the
smoke away. He towers over the terrified Chi Lung.

YEN LO
Judges... the time limit has
expired. Your duty is clear.

They turn to Chi.

CHI LUNG
No! I got you virgins. Look at
all the trouble I caused. Hell
would be nothing without guys
like me!

Chi takes Kim as a hostage... and grabs the THIRD CHAI TAO
PIECE from her hand. Steve lunges for him but he threatens
Kim with knifelike claws. Kim slams her elbow into his gut.
96.

The CHAI flies from his hands, lands at her feet. She
@ropkicks it to Steve. The demon in Chi rises up, horrible,
threatening...

CHI LUNG
Give me that jade...

Steve slams the third piece into place and makes the complete
CHAI TAO!

STEVE
Go to Hell!

YEN LO
As you wish.

FROM THE JADE - A BLAST KNOCKS STEVE AWAY THEN SHOOTS AT CHI
LIKE A SPEAR THROUGH HIS SOLAR PLEXIS. He's rocketed up.
Below, a hole opens.

THE ENTRANCE TO HELL

Chi Lung is swept in and plunges down... screaming all the
way.

ACT SEVEN
97,

INT. THRONE ROOM - AT THE ENTRANCE TO HELL

They all look down into the chasm. When the dust clears,
there is no sign of Chi Lung. There are only bits of cloth
floating up from the hole. Brad picks up the CHAI TAO,
studies it. Yen Lo looks on complaisantly.

YEN LO
Never liked that guy.

Kim runs to the fallen Steve. She drops to him.

KIM
No. It can't be.

YEN LO
The decision of the judges
is final.

KIM

No. Please. You must return
him to me!

YEN LO
Impossible.

She grabs the Chai Tao from Brad, points it at Yen Lo.

KIM
The Chai Tao. I can make
a wish, right?

YEN LO
That is correct.

She slams the pieces together. POP! A BEAM shoots. Virgin
souls suck back into their bodies. Flame Lords revert from
demons to punks. The Judges disappear.

KIM
I now wish all those who are
pure in heart remain...
Everyone else can go to Hell!!
The air BURSTS, the WIND WHIPS fiercely. The White Hearts
drop back, shielding their eyes. The dust settles, Kim
stands with Steve at her side. Egg is there with the
virgins. Yen Lo vanishes.

EGG SHEN
{to virgins)
You know I really didn't think
that would work.

KIM
I... believed...

She and Steve are looking deeply into each other's eyes...
getting lost... Egg Shen prattles on...

EGG SHEN
You are very impressive for
an... American.

KIM
Thanks.

Steve suddenly notices a lifeless body.

STEVE
Bobby...
EGG SHEN
He fought Chi.
DOUBLE
And possibly saved his soul.
STEVE
Aw, you know... He wasn't so

bad. He shouldn't go to hell.

The Chai Tao glows in Kim's hand. It radiates a
greenish/white light.

EGG
I think Yen Lo heard you.
Bobby's soul will be at peace.

BRAD
I don’t get it.

KIM
(ironic)
It's because we Chinese are
inscrutable.
They kiss.

EXT. LITTLE CHINA -

The KISS continues.

99.

STEVE
I don't know, I find you
highly scrutable.

KIM
You're kind of interesting
yourself...in a goyish way.

STEVE
I'm just trying to learn...

EGG SHEN
That's admirable, Grasshopper.
Now, If you just cut out those
one liners. I may take you on.

STEVE
As your partner?

EGG SHEN
Apprentice. We must now search
for three new guardians for the

Chai Tao.
STEVE
We've got one right here.
KIM
Not me, I've got my own
career.
STEVE
You sure I can't change your
mind?
KIM

You can try. A little of that
old black magic...

STEVE
Thought you didn't believe
in that...

KIM
Convince me...

IN FRONT OF EGG'S SHOP - NEXT DAY

Then Kim breaks. Clarence walks out of

Egg's shop, hands Steve a cellular phone. Egg, Brad and

Double stand in the

B.G..
100.

CLARENCE
He's still yelling. You better
take it.

STEVE
Yeah, Dad, the jade...
It's lost...yep, sorry. No
way to get it back. Well,
Sorry you feel like that. But
I'm afraid that jade is gone
for good.

He winces at a LOUD BLAST as the phone is slammed down...

STEVE
Oh, and say hello to Mom.

CLARENCE
He's kinda mad at you. Maybe
you should stay in Little China...
it's a lot quieter than out
there...

Clarence, gets in his car, winks at him and pulls away. Steve
turns to him.

KIM
I'll see you again.

STEVE
And I'll see you.

Kim climbs into the truck with Brad.

STEVE
Take care of her.
BRAD
I don't think she needs

my help.

Brad offers his hand. Rivalry exists, but also friendship.
Kim hands Steve the piece of Jade. He fits the pieces
together to form the complete CHAI TAO, but Egg takes them.

EGG SHEN
They must stay separate,
Grasshopper. It's better
that way.

He hands Steve the single museum piece.
101.

EGG SHEN
See if you can take better
care of this.

STEVE

Really?! You mean that?
EGG SHEN

Yes, my apprentice... I do.
STEVE

We both will... okay?
Egg gives the second piece to Kim.

EGG SHEN
Okay.
(turns to Brad)
But the secret must stay
hidden. It's better that we forget
about this.

Egg makes a quick magical motion. Something comes over Brad.

BRAD
Forget about what?

Steve puts his arm around Egg's shoulder.

STEVE
Louie, I think this is the
start of a beautiful...
(looks at Egg. A beat.)
....uh... apprenticeship.

Egg laughs. They walk off arm in arm.
EXT. - LITTLE CHINA
Kim drives away. Brad pulls out a beer.
BRAD
You know... everyone talks
about Chinese magic and stuff.
I don't believe any of it,

do you Kim.

KIM
No, Brad... not a word.
w
oO
nN

Popping off the lid, Brad tilts his head back to drink.

Green smoke rises out of the bottle as he raises it to his

mouth. Kim starts to warn him as we.....-

ZOOM UP AND AWAY...FROM BIG TROUBLE...

THE END
