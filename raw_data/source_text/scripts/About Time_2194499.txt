INT. FAMILY HOME. DAY. / EXT. BEACH. DAY./ EXT. GARDEN. 1
NIGHT.

THE FILM STARTS WITH A VOICE-OVER - SHOWING WHAT TIM, THE
LEADING MAN, IS DESCRIBING. HE IS 21. AS HE TALKS ABOUT EACH
MEMBER OF THE FAMILY, THE CAMERA STAYS WITH THEM UNTIL THEY
ARE PASSED BY ANOTHER FAMILY MEMBER, WHO THE CAMERA THEN
FOLLOWS. ONE FLOWING MORNING IN THEIR RAMBLING SEA-SIDE HOME.

TIM (V.O.)
I always knew we were a fairly odd
family.

First there was me - too tall, too
skinny, too orange - unfortunate
hair.

My mum was lovely, but not like
other mums - there was something
solid about her, something
rectangular - her fashion icon was
the Queen Mother - I never remember
her not in tweed.

Dad, well, he was more normal. He
always seemed to have time on his
hands - after giving up teaching

university students on his 50th

birthday, was always available for
a leisurely cup of tea, or to let
me win at table tennis once more.

Then there was Mum’s brother, Uncle
D. Always impeccably dressed, he
spent the days just, well, being
Uncle D. He was the same age as Mum
but by the time I was 8, he was
really my younger brother.

And then finally, there was
Catherine, Katie, Kit Kat. Ina
household of suits and hair cuts,
there was this - what can I call
her - nature thing. With her big
oval eyes, her wild hair, her
purple t-shirts, her torn jeans and
her eternally bare feet - she was
then and still is, to me, about the
most wonderful thing in the world.

All in all - it was a pretty good
childhood - full of repeated

rhythms and patterns - charades in
the winter, with me always losing -

croquet with Uncle D every summer -
and by the time I was 21, we were
still having tea on the beach every
single day, no matter what the
weather...

SCENE OF THEM TRYING TO HAVE TEA ON THE BEACH ON A VERY BLOWY
AUTUMN AFTERNOON. MUM IN SCARF, UNCLE D IN THREE-PIECE SUIT,
DAD LAUGHING AT IT ALL, KIT KAT IN PURPLE T-SHIRT AND TORN
JEANS —- MAKING A FIRE WITH STICKS FOUND ON THE BEACH, TRYING
TO LIGHT IT, PUTTING ON AN OLD KETTLE. ONE CUP OF TEA TAKES
ABOUT HALF AN HOUR. A SCONE DROPS IN THE SAND - TIM’S MOTHER
SURREPTITIOUSLY PICKS IT UP, SCRAPES OFF THE SAND AND PUTS IT
BACK ON THE PLATE.

TIM (V.O.)
And then every Friday evening - a
film.

A NIGHT-TIME SHOT OF THEM WATCHING A MOVIE, PROJECTED ONTO
THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE - ALL OF THEM IN DECKCHAIRS. IT STARTS
TO DRIZZLE —- AND UP GO SIX UMBRELLAS - NO-ONE MOVES. KIT KAT
JUST RELISHES THE RAIN.

TIM (V.O.)
And then, once a year, the ghastly
New Year’s Eve party...

INT. FAMILY HOME. NIGHT. 2

A NEW YEAR'S PARTY. THE BEST SONGS FROM 2005 PLAY. AN AWKWARD
MIXTURE OF YOUNG PEOPLE, OLD PEOPLE AND CHILDREN. THERE'S ONE
YOUNG MAN DANCING WITH PECULIAR, UNWARRANTED CONFIDENCE -
TIM’S FRIEND JAY. WE SEE TIM SORT OF SMILING HOPEFULLY AT A
PRETTY GIRL - SHE IGNORES HIM IN FAVOUR OF A HANDSOMER GUY.
HE ENDS UP DANCING WITH A GIRL TWICE HIS SIZE, POLLY - SHE,
IN CONTRAST, GIVES HIM A VERY WELCOMING SMILE.

KIT KAT IS TALKING TO A TOO GOOD LOOKING LOUCHE YOUNG MAN.

CUT ON - TIM IS JUST TRYING TO GET THROUGH THE NIGHT -—
AVOIDING DRUNK PEOPLE. ONE PERSON NUDGES A TABLE AND 27 WINE
BOTTLES ALL SPILL AT ONCE.

SUDDENLY IT IS MIDNIGHT - A BIG COUNTDOWN TO THE BIG MOMENT.
TIM FINDS HIMSELF NEAR THE NOW RATHER DRUNK POLLY - SHE MOVES
TOWARDS HIM, LEANING IN FOR A NEW YEAR KISS. HE PANICS.
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. FINALLY, ON THE DOT OF MIDNIGHT, AS
ALL AROUND HIM EVERYONE IS KISSING, HE JUST TAKES HER HAND
AND SHAKES IT FIRMLY.

TIM
Happy New Year. Sorry.

THEY LOOK AROUND - EVERYONE ELSE IS KISSING. KIT KAT IS

KISSING THE HANDSOMEST, COOLEST, NASTIEST LOOKING BOY AT THE
PARTY.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
3.

A SWEET 23 YEAR OLD, TEDDY, HAS SWEPT HIS PRETTY 10 YEAR OLD
SISTER, AMBER, OFF HER FEET, KISSING HER ON THE CHEEK.

AS TIM HOLDS POLLY'S HAND, WE SEE A TEAR APPEAR IN THE CORNER
OF HER EYE. FOR HER, IT’S A PROFOUNDLY SAD MOMENT - NO-ONE
LOVES HER. SHE WALKS AWAY. TIM IS MORTIFIED. SHAKES HIS HEAD.
BAD START TO THE YEAR.

INT. TIM’S BEDROOM. MORNING. 3
A WIDE WINDOW OVERLOOKS THE CAMOMILE LAWN AND THEN THE SEA.

TIM (V.O.)
And so I woke up the next morning,
hung over, ashamed of myself and
not realising it was the day that
would change my life forever.

KIT KAT ENTERS IN THE PURPLE T-SHIRT SHE SLEEPS IN.

KIT KAT
Wake up, Stupid. Dad wants you.

INT. DAD'S STUDY. MORNING. 4

TIM OPENS THE DOOR AND ENTERS - IT'S A BIG OLD FASHIONED
STUDY - BOOKS AND RECORDS LINE THE WALL MASSIVELY - WHERE
THERE AREN'T BOOKSHELVES, THERE ARE PAINTINGS OF OLD
RELATIVES. AGAIN, VIEW OUT ON TO CRAGGY TREES AND THE
ENORMOUS SEA BEHIND.

HIS DAD IS A FAMILIAR, LIVED IN, QUITE FORMAL MAN. DEEPLY
CIVILIZED AND ATTRACTIVE.

DAD
Ah, Tim, come in... Do sit down.

TIM
This is all very formal.

THEY HAVE A PRETTY GOOD RELATIONSHIP - IRONIC AND FAMILIAR,
EVEN IF NOT COMPLETELY CLOSE.

DAD
Well, yes, ahm, this is an odd
moment for me - because I had
exactly the same moment with my
Father, when I’d just turned 21 -
and after it, my life was never the
same - so, I approach it pretty
nervously.

TIM

Okay - when you're ready. All very
mysterious.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
AN ODD PAUSE.

DAD

Alright. Right. Tim - my dear son -
the simple fact is that the men in
this family have always had the
ability to... This is going to
sound strange. Be prepared for
strangeness. But there’s this
family secret - and the secret is
that all the men in the family can -
travel in time.

(HEADING ON FAST)
Well, more accurately, travel back
in time. I mean, once we’ve
travelled back, we can of course
travel forward back to the present,
but we can't travel into the future
from now.

CUT BACK TO TIM. HE IS PERFECTLY STILL. THEN...

TIM
This is such a weird joke...
DAD
It’s not a joke.
TIM
It’s got to be a joke.
DAD
It’s seriously not a joke.
TIM
So you're saying that you, and
granddad, and his brothers... could

all travel back in time?

DAD
Yes.
TIM
And you still do?
DAD
Absolutely.
TIM
Okay - if it’s true - which it
isn’t...
DAD

Although it is...
TIM

Although it isn’t, obviously. But
if it was, which it’s not...

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
PAUSE.

DAD
Which it is...

TIM
Which it isn’t - but if it was, how
would I actually..?

DAD
The 'how’ is the easy bit in fact.
You go into a dark place - big
cupboards very useful generally -
toilets at a pinch - then you
clench your fists like this, think
about the moment you’re going to,
and you'll find yourself there.
After a bit of a stumble and a
rumble and a tumble.

TIM
Wow.

DAD
.»..is as good a reaction as any. I
think I plumped for 'fuck'. But it
was the 80s.

TIM
Do you mind if I just take a few
moments to think about it?

DAD
Please do. I’1l just be here.

TIM HEADING OUT.

TIM
No - no - this is so obviously just
a joke.

DAD

It’s not. Why would I lie?

TIM
Okay. Well, I mean, there’s
obviously only one way to settle
this.

DAD
Yes. Obviously.

TIM
But when I come back downstairs -
after standing in a cupboard with
my fists clenched - you’re going to
be in so much trouble. I mean it.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
DAD
Let’s see, shall we? And Tim... Try
to do something useful. You want
the first time to be interesting at
least.

TIM
So much trouble. I mean it. Really.

INT. TIM’S BEDROOM. DAY. 5

TENSE MUSIC. TIM ENTERS HIS BEDROOM CUPBOARD CEREMONIOUSLY.
THEN CLOSES HIS EYES, CLENCHES HIS FIST. THEN SOMETHING
HAPPENS. A TINY VISION OF THE TIME BEING PASSED THROUGH - A
FEW RANDOM IMAGES, LIKE TRAVELLING THROUGH A TIME TUNNEL. CUT
OUTSIDE INTO HIS BEDROOM. IT IS NIGHT - TIM STEPS OUT -
DRESSED AS HE WAS FOR THE NEW YEAR'S PARTY.

INT. MAIN HALL. NIGHT. 6

TIM WALKS DOWN THE STAIRS - UTTERLY STUNNED BY THE
STRANGENESS OF LIVING SOMETHING FOR THE SECOND TIME.

FRIEND JAY
You okay, Tim?

TIM
Yes. Good, good.

HE CUNNINGLY STOPS THE SPILLAGE OF THE 27 WINE BOTTLES HE
REMEMBERS FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE.

HE SEES KIT KAT LOCK EYES WITH THE NASTY HANDSOME BOY SHE WAS
LATER KISSING.

CUT FORWARD TO MIDNIGHT. THE SAME MOMENT AT THE PARTY WHEN HE
FAILED TO KISS POLLY. AND INSTEAD OF SHAKING HER HAND - HE
NOW KISSES HER. IT MAKES HER SO HAPPY.

POLLY
Thank you, Tim.

TIM
You're welcome, Polly.

AND HE HEADS OFF INTO A DARK ROOM, OFF THE PARTY ROOM...

INT. TIM’S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 7

HE’S BACK IN THE CUPBOARD AGAIN. HE LOOKS AT HIS WATCH - HIS
CLOTHES. YES, HIS LIFE HAS UTTERLY CHANGED. HE STEPS OUT OF
THE CUPBOARD, DAZED. AT WHICH MOMENT, POLLY COMES IN FROM THE
BATHROOM. SHE IS WEARING JUST A TOWEL...

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
POLLY
I've actually never done this
before.

TIM, IN TOTAL SHOCK ALREADY, IS JOLTED INTO TOTAL SHOCK
NUMBER TWO. AN ALMOST NAKED STRANGE GIRL IN HIS BEDROOM.

TIM
Really?

POLLY
But then no-one has ever really
kissed me before - so I thought, if
I'm going to lose my virginity with
someone, it might as well be you.

TIM
Great news.

POLLY
I told Mum I was going to stay at
Shirley's - so we've got all night.
This (HER BODY) is yours for 12
hours. Do with it as you will, Tim
Lake.

TIM
Great. Great. Will you just give me
one second?

POLLY
Of course - ‘man stuff’.

HE GOES INTO THE BATHROOM, SWITCHES OFF THE LIGHT, CRUNCHES
HIS FIST - AND GOES BACK TO THE NEW YEAR'S PARTY.
INT. MAIN HALL / BEDROOM. NIGHT. 8

MIDNIGHT AGAIN. AND ONCE AGAIN TIM SHAKES HER HAND. THE TEAR
FALLS FROM HER EYE AGAIN.

TIM
I really AM sorry.

AND THEN TIM ARRIVES BACK IN HIS BEDROOM. STEPS OUT. HIS LIFE
IS UTTERLY CHANGED.

INT. FATHER’S STUDY. DAY. 9
HE HEADS DOWN INTO HIS DAD'S STUDY - OPENS THE DOOR - OPENS

HIS ARMS IN AMAZEMENT —- ‘WHAT THE HELL’ - DAD SHRUGS HIS
SHOULDERS - ‘WHAT DID I TELL YOU?’

EXT. BEACH. DAY. 10
CUT TO TIM WALKING ALONG THE BEACH - PASSIONATE, UNFOLDING
MUSIC. HE IS LOST IN HIS THOUGHTS AND AMAZEMENT.

INT. DAD'S STUDY. EVENING. 11

TIM IS BACK IN THE STUDY WITH HIS DAD. FULL OF URGENT
QUESTIONS NOW.

TIM
Does Mum know?
DAD
Not a whistle.
TIM
Strange. And what about the
whole. .?
DAD

Butterfly effect thing - what can I
say, we don't seem to have messed
up civilization yet...

TIM
It’s going to be a complicated
year.

DAD

It’s going to be complicated life.
Any ideas how to use it?

TIM
Well, it’s going to take a lot of
thinking about - what have you
done... with it?

DAD

For me it’s books, books, books.
I've read everything a man could
hope to. Twice. Dickens three
times. And music of course.

(GESTURES TO ALL HIS

RECORDS )
And then, I've got to spend more
time with you and the family. What
are you thinking?

TIM
Well, apart from changing this
haircut, money would be the obvious
thing.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
12

DAD
Very mixed blessing. Utterly fucked
up your grandfather's life - left
him without love or friends. I've
never bumped into a genuinely happy
rich person.

TIM
But it would be nice not to have to
work.

DAD

No - that’s a real recipe for
disaster. Look what happened to
your Uncle Fred.

TIM
What happened to Uncle Fred?

DAD
Nothing. Absolutely sod all. Wasted
his life. You have to use it for
things that will really make your
life how you want it to be.

TIM
Well. I suppose, to be honest, for
the moment, I really just hope it's
going to get me a girlfriend.

DAD
Wow. Big one.

TIM
Yup - the mothership.

TIM (V.O.)

For me, it was always going to be
all about love. Of course - there
were some old scores to be
settled....

INT. LECTURE HALL. DAY. 12

TIM’S HAIR IS A BIT DIFFERENT - IT’S A YEAR BACK, HIS FINAL
MOMENT AT UNIVERSITY. A SLOUCHY ARROGANT TUTOR ADDRESSES THE
SMALL CLASS.

TUTOR
Well, we draw near the close of
your ignominious time here. I wish
you all the best, although I fear
the worst. God help the legal
system if you lot are entering it.

TIM RAISES HIS HAND...

10.

TUTOR (CONT'D)
Yes, Lake, what is it?

TIM
Can I just say, sir, on behalf of
all of us, that we also wish you
the best - but fear the worst.
You’re the worst teacher any
student has ever had - you’re not
only stupid, you’re arrogant,
aggressive, sleazy and wouldn’t
recognise an original thought if it
gave you a tender and caring blow-
job.

TUTOR
You are in such trouble, young man.

TIM
Or not. Excuse I’m just popping to
the toilet for a moment...

INT. TIM’S ROOM. DAY. 13

TIM IS CASUALLY DRESSED FOR THE DAY, BAGGY TROUSERS, OLD
SHORT-SLEEVED SHIRT.

TIM (V.O.)
But it was in the summer holidays,
that the real business began. I
walked downstairs and into love.

EXT/INT. THE HOUSE. DAY. 14

KIT KAT’S LITTLE PURPLE CAR ENTERS THE DRIVE - TIM MOOCHES
OUT OF THE HOUSE - AND OUT OF THE CAR STEPS THE MOST
BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE HAS EVER SEEN. SLOW MOTION AND MUSIC AS
THIS SEXUAL ANGEL ENTERS HIS LIFE. HE IS ABSOLUTELY FROZEN.

KIT KAT
Charlotte, this is Tim.

TIM
No it’s not. Excuse me.

TIM RUNS INTO THE HOUSE. RUSHES INTO A CUPBOARD. GRIPS HIS
FISTS. RUSHES UPSTAIRS. TRIES ON FOUR DIFFERENT OUTFITS -
TRIES TO LOOK COOL IN EACH OF THEM. SHAVES. EVEN CUTS HIS
HAIR A TINY BIT. PLUCKS HIS NOSE. AND THEN HEADS DOWNSTAIRS
AND TRIES TO LOOK CASUAL AS THE CAR PULLS UP. OUT STEPS
CHARLOTTE, PARADISE AGAIN.

KIT KAT
Charlotte, this is Tim.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z

CHARLOTTE
Hi, Tim.

TIM
Hi, Charlotte.

CHARLOTTE
I think you know my brother.

TIM
Really?

CHARLOTTE
Jimmy Kincade.

TIM
O Jesus.

CHARLOTTE

You don’t like him?

TIM
No - he’s - he’s a character.

CHARLOTTE
Your sister loves him.

TIM IS PUZZLED.
KIT KAT
True - not many guys will sleep
with you on the first date.

TIM
You slept with Jimmy Kincade?

CHARLOTTE
Wow, you really don’t like him.

TIM
Excuse me a moment. Can do better.

THE CAR DRIVES BACK IN...

KIT KAT
Charlotte this is Tim.

TIM
Hi, Charlotte.

CHARLOTTE
I think you know my brother,
Jimmy Kincade.

TIM

O yes, what a guy. How is the old
bastard?

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z

TIM (V.O.)
She was heaven. And staying the
whole summer.

15 INT. BEDROOM. MORNING. 15

TIM IN HIS ROOM IN HIS PYJAMAS - HE EMERGES AND THERE COMING
TOWARDS HIM, ALONG THE CORRIDOR, IS CHARLOTTE.

CHARLOTTE
Wow - nice pyjamas. I’ve never met
anyone who wears a pyjama.

TIM
Really? What do people wear in bed
these days?

CHARLOTTE
T-shirt and boxers. Or nothing.

TIM
Right. Of course.

CUT BACK INSIDE HIS ROOM. HE’S NOW WEARING A T-SHIRT OVER
SOME COOLER BAGGY TROUSERS. HE GOES BACK INTO THE CORRIDOR -—
CHARLOTTE COMING FROM EXACTLY THE SAME DIRECTION AS BEFORE.

CHARLOTTE
Hey. I had you down for a pyjama
kind of guy.

TIM

No. T-shirt and boxers. Or nothing,
of course.

KIT KAT COMES ALONG THE CORRIDOR.

KIT KAT
Why are you wearing that?
TIM
What?
KIT KAT
What happened to your penguin
pyjamas?
TIM

Pyjamas? Not me. No. Bloody hell -
pyjamas - come on!

THE GIRLS HEAD ON DOWNSTAIRS - TIM GOES BACK INTO HIS ROOM.
HE PUTS THE PYJAMA TOPS AND TROUSERS BACK ON AND IS STANDING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM WHEN THERE IS A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.
HE JUST HAS TIME TO LEAP INTO BED, WHEN THE DOOR OPENS. THERE
IS CHARLOTTE - HE GETS THE DUVET RIGHT UP TO HIS CHIN JUST IN
TIME TO HIDE THE PYJAMAS.

CHARLOTTE
We thought we might head to the
beach. Coming?

TIM
Yup. Be right there.

HE DOES NOT MOVE.

EXT. BEACH. DAY. 16

THEY ARE ON THE BEACH. TIM READING A BOOK, THE GIRLS ON THEIR
FRONT, ON TOWELS, SUNBATHING.

CHARLOTTE
Tim, will you do my back?

SHE HOLDS OUT SOME SUNCREAM.

TIM (V.O.)
Absolutely.

HE BOUNCES UP.

CHARLOTTE
Wow. Keen.

HE’S A BIT EMBARRASSED. HE TAKES THE CREAM, HOLDS IT OVER HER
BACK - SQUIRTS. THE TOP FALLS OFF - A HUGE DOLLOP COVERS HER
BACK... SHE SCREAMS. CUT RIGHT BACK...

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
Tim, will you do my back.

TIM
Sure - give us a sec...

HE READS A FEW MORE LINES (IT’S TOUGH TO DELAY, BUT HE DOES
IT...) THEN DRIFTS OVER. HE TAKES THE CREAM CAREFULLY, PUTS A
LITTLE ON HIS HAND AND THEN RUBS IT IN SMOOTHLY.
CHARLOTTE
Nice...

INT. DINING ROOM. EVENING. 17

IT’S DINNER - TIM, AS EVER, FOCUSSING ENTIRELY ON CHARLOTTE
AND EVERYTHING SHE DOES. THEY ARE EATING SOUP.

CHARLOTTE
What flavour is the soup?

MOTHER
Cauliflower.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
14.

DAD
Ah - the only problem with
cauliflower I find, is that it
tastes like cauliflower.

CHARLOTTE LAUGHS A LOT AT THAT.

TIM
Excuse me one minute.

HE GETS UP TO LEAVE. CUT TO EXACTLY THE SAME SCENE, A FEW
SECONDS EARLIER.

DAD
What flavour is the soup?

MOTHER
Cauliflower.

TIM JUMPS IN...

TIM
The only problem with cauliflower,
in my humble opinion, is that it
always tastes like cauliflower.

CHARLOTTE
O, I quite like it.

TIM SCRATCHES HIS HEAD. WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

TIM (V.O.)
It was the summer from heaven - it
was the summer from hell. I invited
my friend Teddy round for tennis
because I knew he’d make me look
good.

TIM AND THE SWEET GUY FROM THE PARTY WHO WAS DANCING WITH THE
10 YEAR OLD ON ONE SIDE - TIM CLEARLY THE BETTER PLAYER. ON
THE OTHER SIDE KIT KAT AND CHARLOTTE, WEARING A TIGHT T-SHIRT
AND TINY SKIRT. KIT KAT IS MORE INTERESTED IN MAKING SHAPES
THAN SHOTS —- BUT CHARLOTTE IS VERY GOOD.

TIM (V.O.)
Unfortunately Charlotte just made
both of us look like idiots. How
the hell are you meant to
concentrate on your game with this
sort of shit going down?

UTTER SLO-MO GORGEOUSNESS, AS THE CAMERA WATCHES CHARLOTTE'S
BEAUTY AS SHE RUNS, SERVES, DRINKS WATER, LEAPS TO CATCH A
HIGH BALL. THE ULTIMATE BEAUTIFUL GIRL TENNIS FANTASY.

TIM (V.0.)

It never got better - until it was
almost too late.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z

18 INT. FAMILY DINING ROOM. DAY. 18

THEY ARE SITTING AT THE FAMILY DINING TABLE FOR A NICE STEW
AT LUNCH.

DAD
Well, Charlotte, our final lunch -
it's been lovely having you all
summer, hasn't it, Uncle D.

UNCLE D
Beg your pardon?

MUM
Lovely having Charlotte here all
summer.

UNCLE D
Who is Charlotte?

MUM
Come on darling - Charlotte. Next
to you.

UNCLE D
Ah yes - Charlotte - lovely to meet
you - how long are you staying?

CHARLOTTE
I'm leaving today.

UNCLE D
Alas - would have been wonderful to
get to know each other.

19 INT. FAMILY HOME CORRIDOR. NIGHT. 19

LATER THAT NIGHT. TIM TURNS A CORNER AND THERE IS CHARLOTTE.

TIM
Charlotte - as it’s the final day -
the last night, can I... ask you a
question?

CHARLOTTE

Ask away. O no - wait - it's not
going to be about love is it?

TIM
What?

CHARLOTTE
Kit Kat warned me about this and
said that if you ever mentioned it,
I should be very firm and say that
you must treat me like a sister and
not be stupid.

CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
Or have I made a total fool of
myself and you were going to ask me
for last minute tennis tips?

TIM
No, it was about... the other
thing.

CHARLOTTE

Well, that's very sweet of you.

HIM DEEP IN THE EYES. THINKING... HIS LIFE IN HER

CHARLOTTE (CONT’D)
Shame you left it till the last
night - you should have tried
creeping along the corridor while
we still had time.

TIM
Okay. Okay. Last night a bad idea?

CHARLOTTE
Last night a very bad idea - seems
like an afterthought. Last night
was never going to work.

TIM
Okay. Good.

AWAY. AND TIM WALKS STRAIGHT INTO A NEARBY

INT. CORRIDOR. NIGHT. 20

CUT TO THE UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR THAT NIGHT. TIM EMERGES CREAKILY
FROM HIS ROOM —- AND EDGES TOWARDS ANOTHER DOOR. HE OPENS THE
DOOR GENTLY... AND WALKS IN....

CHARLOTTE
Tim.

TIM
Yes. Hi.

CHARLOTTE

Can I help?

TIM
Well, yes - there is just one thing
- I know you’ve probably suspected
this - but in the last fortnight, I
have fallen completely in love with

you.

TIM (CONT'D)

Now, obviously, this was going to
happen, because you’re the
prettiest girl in history with the
prettiest face and the prettiest
hair... but even if, you know, you
didn’t have the face and you had,
absolutely no hair for some bizarre
reason, I’d still adore you - not
in a schoolboy way, in a really
profound adult but not threatening
way, and I just wondered whether by
any chance you might share my
feelings?

CHARLOTTE
Wow. Ahm. I tell you what. Why
don’t you ask me again on my last
night?

TIM
Your last night.

CHARLOTTE
Yeh. Try me on the last night.
Let’s see what happens then.

TIM
Right. Perfect. Just perfect.

HE STANDS OUTSIDE THE DOOR ALONE. AND KNOWS THE TRUTH.

EXT. FAMILY HOME. DAY. 21

THE FINAL DAY. CHARLOTTE IN ALL HER GLORY STEPS INTO THE CAR -
TIM JUST WATCHES HER - SHE TURNS IN THE BACK WINDOW AND WAVES
GENTLY AS THE CAR MOVES INTO THE DISTANCE.

TIM (V.O.)

And so the love of my life drove,
just drove away. All the time
travel in the world couldn't help
me there. And the next day it was
my turn to leave.

EXT. FAMILY HOME. DAY. 22

HE IS STANDING NEXT TO A TAXI WITH HIS CASES.

HIS DAD SMILES, KIT KAT JUMPS ON HIM WITH A HUG, LEGS ROUND
HIS WAIST. UNCLE D SLIPS HIM A 50 PENCE COIN, WITH A WINK...

UNCLE D
Don’t spend it all at once, son.

23 INT/EXT. ST JOHNS WOOD. DAY. 23

SHOTS OF LONDON ON A SPRING DAY. LITTLE FLASHES OF ITS
IDIOSYNCRATIC MISCELLANY.

TIM (V.O.)
I caught the train to London and
headed for my digs, staying with an
old friend of the family, who had
apparently fallen on slightly hard
times and needed the rent. It
turned out to be just a few yards
from Abbey Road - fans lining up by
the crossing and risking their
lives to have their photos taken...

HE WALKS PAST THE CLUSTER OF PEOPLE LINING UP TO BE
PHOTOGRAPHED ON THE ABBEY ROAD CROSSING, THEN TURNS A CORNER
INTO A TREE-LINED STREET - AND ARRIVES AT A BIG OLD-FASHIONED
RED BRICK HOUSE. THE DOORBELL IS ANSWERED BY A RAMSHACKLE, 50
YEAR OLD, HARRY.

HARRY
What the fuck do you want?
TIM
I'm James' son.
HARRY
Who?
TIM
James Lake.
HARRY
What about him?
TIM
I'm his son. He said you had a
room.
HARRY

Go in there - and wait. Quietly. I
mean it - don't make a fucking
sound.

24 INT. HARRY’S HOUSE. DAY. 24

TIM SITS IN THE SITTING ROOM, THE WALLS COVERED IN POSTERS OF
PLAYS, CLEARLY ALL WRITTEN BY HARRY, WHO NOW REAPPEARS.

HARRY
No - it's gone. I was actually
having the first good idea I've had
for a year, when you rang on the
doorbell - and now it’s gone. You
little shit.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
25

TIM
Sorry.

HARRY
It's upstairs. The room. How's your
Dad? Weird cock I always thought -
something weird about him...

TIM
Really?

HARRY

Yeah. Never really liked him
actually. Your Mum still look like
Winston Churchill? That by the way
is my wife.

(PASSING A PHOTO)
You wouldn't like her at first -
sarcastic cow - but eventually
you'd realize she was the best
human being in the world. Which is
why she has left me, of course.

THEY REACH THE ROOM. A SMALL BUT PRETTY ATTIC ROOM, WITH

SLOPED CEILINGS.

Here we go. Try not to make too
much noise - particularly when
having sex.

TIM
No chance of that.

HARRY LOOKS AT HIM SCORNFULLY.

HARRY

HE LEAVES, PASSING A PICTURE OF A PRETTY GIRL ON THE WALL.

And so I began my adventures in the

TIM ARRIVING AT HIS LEGAL CHAMBERS - QUIET, GRAND, FORMAL.
TIM (V.O.)
It's a strange world, full of very
strange people, both nice...
IN HIS OFFICE, WE SEE HIS CHAOTIC SWEET NERVOUS CO-WORKER.
RORY

Hello. I’m Rory. Very pleased to
meet you. A real thrill. Who knows -

we might become, you know... pals
etc.

TIM (V.O.)
And nasty.

AND HIS NASTY ARROGANT BOSS ENTERS, TAVERNER QC

TAVERNER QC
Who the hell are you?

TIM
I’m Tim Lake.

TAVERNER QC
Well, I hope you’re better than
this clown.... Come on, Roger.

RORY
It's Rory actually. I’ve been here
a year. And a half.
(TO TIM)
Only saying that to be nice - it’s
two years actually.

HE EXITS FULL OF TERROR, PULLING A DESPERATE FACE AT TIM.

TIM (V.O.)
There are lots of things that time
travel can’t help with. On the
other hand - it’s extremely helpful
in actual exams.

27 INT. EXAM HALL. DAY. 27
TIM IN A HUGE HALL WITH A THOUSAND OTHER STUDENTS. TURNING

THIS TIME TIM LOOKS QUITE CONFIDENT - WITH A HAPPY THUMBS UP
TO DESPAIRING RORY.

TIM (V.O.)
For a while I tried to sublimate my
search for love to getting a proper
job - though it's not easy. Come
exams, the girls all look like Kate
Middleton. But I still just looked

ALL THE GIRLS LOVELY IN THEIR EXAM DRESSES. TIM GLIMPSES
HIMSELF IN A MIRROR, UNPROMISING IN A BADLY FITTING SUIT.

TIM ARRIVES HOME ON THE NIGHT OF THE EXAMS - HARRY IS AT WORK
AT THE KITCHEN TABLE. NOT A WORD EXCHANGED AS TIM PASSES, BUT
JUST AS HE STARTS TO HEAD UP THE STAIRS...

HARRY
First night of my play Thursday -
do you want to come?

TIM
Do you know - I'd love to - but
I've got a date.

HARRY
Really? A girl at last? The sad
virgin's rocks finally get offed.

Hi.

TIM
O Hello. I'm Tim.

JOANNA AND JAY IMMEDIATELY LAUNCH INTO THEIR OWN CONFIDENT
FLIRTATIOUS DIALOGUE, AS MARY AND TIM TALK...

MARY
I'm Mary.

TIM
O. That's my mother's name.

MARY
Is that bad?

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
24.

TIM
What do you mean?

MARY
Well, I don't know, but I would've
thought that was quite bad -
because no-one wants to sleep with
their mother - so if someone's got
your mother's name, that's got to
be an initial turn off, initially.

TIM
That's never occurred to me.

MARY
No. Well, good. It'd be worse if I
looked like your mother. Unless
your mother's very beautiful.

TIM
She's not. She’s rectangular.

MARY
Good. Or bad - for your Dad. I'm
sorry for your Dad, but glad for
you - and me, as it were.

LITTLE AWKWARD PAUSE.

TIM
How do you think the conversation
is going?

MARY

Really badly. Can we start again?
9.15 PM
LOUD CONVERSATION FROM THE OTHER TWO.

Jay is quite... enthusiastic.

TIM
I actually hate him. What's Joanna
like?

MARY

JAY
Okay, girls - be honest - who's
more beautiful?

MARY / JOANNA
She is / I am

JAY
Excellent. And I'm blindingly
handsome - Tim's better seen
through a haze of alcohol.

AND HE GOES BACK TO DOMINATING JOANNA WITH NOISY ANECDOTES.

MARY

Actually, I look like Kate Moss.
TIM

Really?
MARY

No. I look a bit like a mouse.

TIM
You like Kate Moss?

MARY
I've loved her all my life.
Seriously. I'm actually wearing one
of her dresses. You?

TIM
No, her stuff doesn't look good on
me.

COMES A VERY PRETTY BROAD FACED GIRL.

JAY (CONT'D)

JOANNA

JAY

Do you fancy some kind of clubbing
experience? And then who knows -
sex - possibly marriage...

JOANNA
Sorry - we've got to rush off. But
help me find a cab - then if you
like, I'll give you my number.

JAY
I like it very much.

CUT TO TIM WHO IS NOW REALLY TENSE. AND THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN.

TIM
Really?

HARRY
Really. Until - and this is the
crucial plot point, I think - until
the lead actor had the most massive
freeze in the history of theatre.

TIM
No!

HARRY
Yes. He didn't just forget his
lines. He forgot his lines to an
extent that no actor has ever
forgotten his lines before in the
annals of dramatic art. In the
crucial courtroom scene. The
reviews won't say “Major
Masterpiece Gets Unveiled” -
they'll say “Major Actor Gets
Alzheimers”.

TIM
It's a disaster?

HARRY
Is an understatement. It's a
catastrophe. It's the Titanic of
play openings. No survivors.

TIM
Okay. I'll see what I can do.

HARRY
What the fuck do you mean ‘what you
can do?’ - what you going to ring

up every critic and offer them a
blow-job if they ignore the fact
that we sat in total silence for

TIM
Yes, I appreciate that. It's just,
I thought - ahm, how's it going
with the lines?

SIR JOHN
'The lines' - what do you mean 'the
lines'?

TIM
It's just - you know - in the court
scene - some of those lines are
pretty complex - I thought it might
be worth just, you know, having one
last look at the lines before you
go on - a little refresher...

‘PSST' - AND HE LOOKS OFF STAGE FOR A MOMENT - AND THERE,
STANDING IN THE WINGS, CARRYING HUGE CARDBOARD CUE CARDS,
WITH THE SPEECH WRITTEN IN BLACK FELT PEN, IS TIM.

JUST IN TIME - BEFORE IT REALLY IS A NOTICEABLE DRY - THE
ACTOR BEGINS TO SPEAK. SPEAK, AND READ, THAT IS - WEAVING HIS
MOVEMENTS AND PACE TO FACE TIM AND GIVE HIM TIME TO FLIP THE
CARDS. IT'S A CRACKING SPEECH.

FORGETFUL ACTOR
Gentlemen. I regard today's
proceedings with utmost gravity.
All the more so because a man's
life is at stake. Nevertheless let
us be clear of one thing - it is

ATTENTION. OUTSIDE THE RING OF FANS HE SPOTS TIM.

HARRY
O look - and here's the little
prick who walked out half way
through. You missed the best scene,
you twerp.

TIM WANDERS OFF ALONE. HE TAKES OUT HIS PHONE. GOES TO THE
ADDRESS BOOK, TYPES IN 'M' THEN 'A'. THERE ARE 'MARYS' - BUT
THERE'S NO 'MARY X'. SHE'S BEEN WIPED FROM HIS PAST.

be that you go to see him straight
away.

RUPERT TAKES OUT HIS PHONE. TIM HAS TO ACT FAST.

TIM (CONT'D)
But don't ring him first.

RUPERT
Why?

TIM
He's not at liberty to make or
receive phone calls, I'm afraid.

RUPERT
I'm sorry - but who are you? -
because there is a scenario here
where you're a random lunatic.

TIM

Right.

(DRAWS BREATH)
Well then let me explain the actual
scenario. I'm a plain clothes
policeman and I'm doing you a
fucking favour because I know how
badly these things can affect the
kids - so, risking my career, I'm
telling you to move your posh arse
in the direction of Paddington
Police station. You weren't your
Dad's one phone call because he
called his lawyer because he
doesn't want to rot in jail for 50
years - but now he desperately
needs a friend - and my sources
tell me you may be the only member
of the family left, with your
mother... gone. But, of course, you
could just go get drunk instead,

into that. You wouldn't like to
come out to dinner with me, would

No, I like the look of you more.

MARY
Easier to get?

TIM
No. Just generally preferable.

MARY
Okay - I might come, if you’re not
crazy. Which you now have to prove.

TIM
Well, let's talk about Kate Moss.

MARY
I actually like Kate Moss.

TIM
I always think the key thing about
her is the history. We all remember
those fantastic pictures of her as
a young school girl on a beach, so
that even now, beneath all the
glamour, we still see the wonderful
young, impish amateur.

MARY

That is exactly right.

MARY
Okay - what do you do, smartarse?

TIM
I'm a lawyer. Sort of.

MARY
Sexy.
TIM
(GENUINELY SURPRISED)
Is it?
MARY

I think so - in a suit, in a court
saving people's lives - that's
quite sexy, isn't it?

TIM
Yes, I guess it is. But not as sexy
as reading. Sitting there, in your
office, in a little chair -
reading.

MARY
Wait right there, mister. A lot of
books get submitted to the
publisher I work for, and it’s my
responsibility to find out if any
of them are masterpieces. No-one
ever forgets the PWIDJKRALB.

TIM
What's that?

MARY
The People Who Turned Down JK
Rowling And Lost Billions.

TIM
Of course. Scary...

MARY
You always worry about that?

TIM
No, I sometimes worry about it.

MARY
Good - because someone who always
worried about that would be a

TIM
Right - but, when you read a

TIM
Hello, Tina - though you should be
a little careful with that, by the
way. There are still quite a lot of
us old-fashioned types who

TIM AND HIS DAD IN THE TABLE TENNIS ROOM. THEIR PLACE. DAD IS

JUST POISED TO SERVE...

DAD
Where’s Mary?

TIM
Fast asleep.

DAD

Sweet. Right -
(TV COMMENTING)

And what an extraordinary game this
is - for the first time a father
and son are playing each other in
the World Table Tennis final - and
neither of them are Chinese.
Tremendous play by the old world
champion and his son, the first
openly gay British ping-pong
player. But it feels like the
youngster's beginning to crack -
there are tears in his eyes...

TIM
There are not.

DAD
There soon will be.

A TRIUMPHANT SMASH.

INT. HALLWAY. DAY.

64

SUDDENLY, ALMOST MAGICALLY, KIT KAT APPEARS TRIPPING DOWN THE

STAIRS AS TIM IS HEADING FOR THE KITCHEN.

TIM
I didn't know you were here.

KIT KAT
Yeah, just popped up for a while.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z

TIM
What about the job?

SHE WRINKLES HER NOSE - OBVIOUSLY THE JOB IS NO MORE.

TIM (CONT'D)
How long have you been here?
KIT KAT

Couple of months.
TIM
Wow. So life in London?
KIT KAT
Horrid. Is Mary here?
TIM
Yes.
KIT KAT
Where?
TIM

Outside, I think.
KIT KAT RUSHES OFF - HE CALLS AFTER HER...

TIM (CONT'D)
Be gentle - be gentle...

BUT IT’S TOO LATE - KIT KAT CHARGES OUT THE DOOR - SEES MARY,
RUNS AT HER - KNOCKS HER TO THE GROUND, PINS HER ARMS AND
STARTS KISSING HER ALL OVER HER FACE.
INT. DINING ROOM. NIGHT. 65
EVERYONE AT DINNER.
TIM
Right - I've got an important

announcement to make.

UNCLE D
O dear.

MUM
What's the problem, D?

UNCLE D
It's the Germans, isn't it. War.

TIM

No, it's not war, Uncle D. It’s
that we've decided to get married.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
65.

ALL SAY “HURRAY!”. KIT KAT SCREAMS WITH JOY AND ASSAULTS MARY
AGAIN. FROM THE GENERAL EXCITEMENT EMERGES UNCLE D.

UNCLE D

Who are you getting married to?
TIM

Mary here.
UNCLE D

Thank God for that - would have
been jolly embarrassing if it had
been another girl. Imagine that -
(TO MARY) you would have looked
like a total gooseberry, wouldn't
you?

DAD
Can I say I've only known Mary for
a few hours, but already I'm sure,
in the event of a nasty divorce,
I'm sticking with her, not Tim.

TIM
Thank you. O, and by the was...
the wedding will be quite soon,
because we're having a baby too.

UNCLE D
You're pregnant?

MARY
Yes.

KIT KAT SCREAMS AGAIN.

UNCLE D

Good lord - who's the father?
MARY

Tim here...
UNCLE D

Thank God for that. Very awkward if
it had been another fella...
66 INT. MARY'S FLAT. NIGHT. 66

NIGHT IN THEIR FLAT A FEW DAYS LATER. TIM IS READING - MARY
ENTERS IN CASUAL TRACKSUIT AND T-SHIRT.

MARY
We have to decide tonight.

TIM
What?

EXPECTANT

SHE TAKES

SHE TAKES

MARY
Everything you've refused to engage
with. Best man. Honeymoon. Where
we're marrying. How many guests.

TIM
We haven't decided any of those?

MARY
The only thing you've decided is
that I will come down the aisle to
the sound of an Italian weirdo
singing a song called Il Mondo.

TIM
Excellent...

MARY
To which I have said a definitive
‘no’. So here's the deal. I will

take off one item of clothing for
every decision you manage to make.
This is a one off offer.
Striptease, in your own living
room, by a woman you think, by your
own admission, is very pretty.

PAUSE.

TIM
Okay. You have my attention, young
lady.

MARY

Right. Good. Where do you think we
should get married?

TIM
Home - I’d hate anywhere else.

OFF HER T-SHIRT, AND IS WEARING A BRA UNDERNEATH.

MARY
Good. Who should the priest be?

TIM
The local bloke with the yellow
teeth and massive uni-brow...

MARY
Okay, that's a lock for Hagrid.

OFF HER BAGGY SWEAT PANTS. SHE HAS NO SOCKS. SHE IS

JUST STANDING THERE IN BRA AND PANTS.

MARY (CONT'D)
Ah. Right. I should have thought
this through first.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
67.

TIM
Yes.
MARY
I should have worn more clothes.
TIM
Yes.
MARY

So I better pick two really
important questions. Best man.

TIM
Damn. I really want to see those
breasts, but...

MARY
Best man. Now.

TIM
This is SO hard. It's lose/lose -
you piss off all the ones you don't
pick and you end up hating the one
you do pick because he makes an
embarrassing speech and ruins your

day.

MARY
Do you want to see these puppies or
not?

TIM

(VERY TENTATIVE) Harry?

MARY
The breasts are the border from
which no decision can ever return.
Harry? Really?

SHE REACHES BACK FOR HER BRA STRAP.

TIM
No. Bad idea. He'll get drunk. Jay?
MARY
Your choice.
TIM
He's my best friend, but he’s a
moron.
MARY

He will fuck up everything, yes.
TIM

Rory - he's boring - but he'll try
SO hard...

MARY
Sure?

TIM
Yes. Definitely. Rory. No, Harry.
It's Harry.

MARY
Okay. It's Harry.

WE SEE FROM BEHIND AS SHE FLICKS OFF HER BRA.

TIM
Actually, no - Rory.

MARY
That is such a cheat. But Rory it
is - it's Rory and it can never
change. Honeymoon?

SHE PLACES HER THUMBS ON HER PANTS.

TIM
Wow - this is turning into an
exceptionally good night. I know
this one! VENICE!!!

MARY
Don’t think we can afford Venice...

TIM
Anywhere, anywhere literally....

INT. FAMILY HOME CHURCH. DAY. 67

CUT TO THE WEDDING DAY. THEY'RE IN A SMALL LOCAL CHURCH NEAR
HOME. ALL THE GUESTS ARE THERE. TIM IS AT THE FRONT WITH HIS
NERVOUS BEST MAN, RORY. HIS WHOLE FAMILY IN THE FRONT ROW.
UNCLE D LOOKING PARTICULARLY RESPLENDENT.

JAY MAKES EYE CONTACT WITH A VERY CUTE BRIDESMAID, JOANNA.
THE PRIEST IS THE YELLOW TOOTHED UNI-BROWED GUY.

A CLANK OF A DOOR - SUDDEN HUSH. THEN, WE SEE A FINGER PUSH A
BUTTON ON A CD PLAYER SOMEWHERE IN THE CHURCH. A VERY
DRAMATIC POP SONG STARTS TO PLAY. THEN AN ITALIAN VOICE
BEGINS TO SING.

CUT TO TIM SHOCKED. CUT TO VARIOUS SURPRISED MEMBERS OF THE
CONGREGATION. CUT TO HIS DAD... AND HIS MUM LOOKING AT HIS
DAD... AND DAD LOOKING AT TIM.

 

WE ALSO SEE BIG POLLY FROM THE BEGINNING - NEXT TO HER
ENORMOUS 6' 8” HUSBAND.

WHEN MARY TURNS INTO THE MAIN AISLE, IN HER HEAVENLY WEDDING
DRESS, TIM IS OVERJOYED.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
68

69.

IT IS HIS REQUEST “IL MONDO”, A HUGE EPIC ITALIAN LOVE
BALLAD. KIT KAT'S BRIDESMAID DRESS IS, BY THE WAY, AN INSANE
PURPLE WONDER.

WHEN WE HIT THE SONG’S CHORUS, TIM’S DAD STARTS TO DO A
GROOVY DANCE MOVEMENT TO IT - AS DOES TIM - AS FINALLY, SO
DOES THE BRIDE, HEADING DOWN THE AISLE... EVENTUALLY, DAD
DOES THE FULL ARMS UP IN THE AIR - AND THEN REALIZES IT'S
SLIGHTLY UNSUITABLE... AND APOLOGISES TO HIS WIFE...

CUT TO THE BRIDE AND GROOM KISSING AT THE ALTAR - WE HEAR
THUNDER - CLEARLY IT’S GETTING STORMY OUTSIDE - THE
CONGREGATION APPLAUD - AND NOW THERE IS MASSIVE RAIN ON THE
WINDOWS. AMONGST THE GUESTS IS THE SWEET LOOKING GUY WHO
DANCED WITH THE 10 YEAR OLD.

CUT TO THE END OF THE SERVICE - AS THE COUPLE COME OUT OF THE
CHURCH, IT IS ABSOLUTELY POURING. THE NEXT TWO MINUTES OF
FILM SHOW THE WORST RAINSTORM/HURRICANE EVER SEEN IN BRITAIN.
IT IS ABSOLUTE CHAOS. WITH A BELLOWING ITALIAN AND A THOUSAND
VIOLINS AS THE SOUNDTRACK.

AS THEY WALK FROM THE CHURCH, THE BRIDE'S TRAIN IS TOTALLY IN
THE SKY - AND THEN TEARS OFF - OLD PEOPLE FALL - SOMEONE IN A
WHEELCHAIR SCOOTS DANGEROUSLY TO THE CLIFF EDGE...

THEY REACH THE COMFORT OF THE MARQUEE - BUT IT'S FALSE
COMFORT - IT TEARS QUICKLY - AND STARTS TO DECONSTRUCT AS
WATER FLOODS IN THROUGH THE HOLES IN THE FABRIC. PEOPLE ARE
HANGING ON FOR DEAR LIFE - SOMEONE IS NEARLY DECAPITATED BY A
FLYING METAL POLE. SOME CHILDREN HAVE FOUND THE UTTER MUD OF
THE GARDEN AND ARE COMPLETELY FILTHY. EVERYONE IS COMPLETELY
SOAKED. A LOT OF THE WOMEN APPEAR TO BE ALMOST NAKED NOW, AS
THEIR WET THIN DRESSES STICK TO THEM LIKE COLOURED FLESH.

IT IS BROAD, REALISTIC, CHAOTIC COMEDY. ALL ACCOMPANIED BY
THE REMAINING, EPIC, ORCHESTRAL MINUTE OF ‘IL MONDO'.

INT. FAMILY HOME / MARY'S FLAT. DAY. 68

THE ENTIRE WEDDING IS NOW BEING SQUEEZED INTO THE UNPREPARED
LIVING ROOM OF THE FAMILY HOUSE. RORY STANDS UP TO SPEAK. HE
IS INCREDIBLY NERVOUS.

RORY
When Tim asked me to be his Best
Man I was terrified, so I thought,
well, the best thing is to finda
book about speeches - and ahm, this
is it and it says “think of really

funny anecdotes” - and there IS one
very funny story actually from
work.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z

RORY (CONT'D)
It was quite a complicated case
based on an issue of cross-
amortization of ownership of post-
divorce properties - and ahm - let
me just explain the context - the
defendant - a certain Mr...

CUT STRAIGHT TO HARRY SPEAKING, IN EXACTLY THE SAME PLACE...

HARRY
When Tim asked me to do his best
man speech, my immediate reaction
was - “how much are you going to
pay me, you little shit? I don’t
write for free, you know...”

CUT BACK TO THE STRIPPING GAME IN THE FLAT...

TIM

I'm going to go for Jay.
MARY

Really?
TIM

Yeh - he might be funny and I'm
pretty sure we can rein him in...

WE CUT RIGHT BACK TO THE RECEPTION. JAY HAS A WHITE BOARD -
WITH A POWERPOINT PRESENTATION.

JAY
These were the girls available in
Tim's teenage years.

SLIDE OF TIM AND, AROUND HIM, FIVE PHOTOS OF GIRLS.
JAY (CONT'D)
And this is how far he got with
each of them.
THERE ARE NOW NUMBERS ON LINES BETWEEN TIM AND THE GIRLS.
JAY (CONT'D)
Let me explain the code. Zero -
obviously nothing. Quite a lot of
those. 5 - blow job. Only one, I’m
afraid.
AND BACK TO MARY AND HER BRA.
TIM
Do you know, I know it's unusual,

but I think I'll go for Dad.

CUT TO DAD FINISHING HIS TOAST AND IT'S GOING WELL...

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
71.

DAD
And so, a toast to the man with the
worst haircut, but the best wife in
the room.

THEY ALL LAUGH AND CLAP AND TIM SMILES AT HIM.
AFTER THE DAD'S SPEECH, THEY CHAT IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM.

DAD (CONT'D)
I wish I'd said that I love you.

TIM
You did, Dad - it was implied...

DAD
I'm not sure 'implied' is good
enough for a wedding day, are you?

PAUSE - THEY BOTH KNOW WHAT HE MEANS.

TIM
Don't do it - it's fine - I'm
really happy with it as it was -
you really don't have to.

DAD
I'll do what I want to do, young
man.

CUT BACK TO THE NEW SPEECH...

DAD (CONT'D)
My natural instinct of course is to
try to be funny about my son - so
many flaws - plays table tennis
like a hairy goat, has never quite
mastered the art of shaving. But
always important, first, to say the
one big thing. I’ve only loved
three men in my life - my Dad was a
frosty bugger - so that only leaves
dear Uncle D - Nat King Cole, of
course - and this young man here.
I'd only give one piece of advice
to anyone marrying. We're all quite
similar in the end, we all get old,
we all wrinkle, we all tell the
same tales too many times - but try
to marry someone... kind. And this
is a kind man - with a good heart.
I'm not particularly proud of many
things in my life - but I'm very
proud to be the father of my son.

AFTERWARDS, BACK IN THE SWING OF THE PARTY...

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
WE SHOULD

72.

KIT KAT
Well done, Daddio. I thought you'd
probably just joke your way through
it.

DAD

I was tempted to - but decided not
to. This time.

BE A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT KIT KAT AGAIN.

DAD (CONT'D)
Are you okay, Kit Kat?

KIT KAT
O yes - I'm good, very good. Orange
juice, no vodka - or is it the
other way round?

SHE TOASTS HIM IN VODKA.

UNCLE D
You next, Kittle Kattle?

KIT KAT
I don't know Uncle D. Boys aren’t
very nice.

UNCLE D
Aren't they, darling?

KIT KAT
Not in my experience. Always taking
liberties. Not giving much back in
return.

UNCLE D
O dear.

SHE'S GETTING DRUNK AND JIMMY KINCADE IS IGNORING HER. TIED
INTO THE FACT THAT KIT KAT WAS AT HOME WHEN THEY ANNOUNCED
THEIR PROPOSAL, AND THAT SHE’S JOBLESS, IT IS STARTING TO BE
A NAGGING WORRY, THE DIMMING OF THIS GORGEOUS GIRL.

CUT TOWARDS THE END OF THE RECEPTION...

OLDER WOMAN
I'm so sorry to disturb you - but I
wonder if I could have your
autograph.

HARRY
No - no! Fuck off. It's a wedding
for God's sake.

HARRY (CONT'D)
I'm here to celebrate true love -
not to hand out stupid bits of
paper with my illegible signature
on it that you can flog on eBay, so
at the next wedding you can afford
to buy a less hideous hat.

TIM
I see you've met my mother-in-law.

HARRY
O God - (TO HER) you might have
told me. People should wear name
tags.

MOTHER IN LAW
What would you have said if you'd

known?

HARRY
‘Sod off’, rather than ‘fuck off’,
I suppose.

A FEW FINAL WEDDING IMAGES, AND A FINAL WORRYING MOMENT WITH
KIT KAT, OUT COLD, JIMMY JUST CASUALLY SMOKING BESIDE HER,
NOT WORRYING. CUT TO MUM AND DAD ROMANTICALLY WALTZING...

THEN MOVE FROM THEM DANCING TO TIM AND MARY. MARY TAKES A
GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE FROM A WAITER AND DOWNS IT.

TIM
Do you wish we'd picked another
day?

MARY

Not for all the world.

INT. WEDDING BEDROOM. 69

TIM IS LOOKING AT HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE, IN HER NIGHTGOWN. SHE
TURNS TO HIM.

youououou...”

AT HIS WONDERFUL BRIDE.

O Jesus. What do we need? Ahm...
MARY
I've done it all - it's all in the
bag.
TIM

MARY
Everything. Every single thing.
Just get the car. All you have to
do is drive me to the hospital.

TIM
Right. Okay. Excellent.

THEY ARE SQUEEZED INTO THE CAR - HE SETS OFF, NERVOUSLY...

MARY
Where are we going?

TIM
To the hospital.

MARY
Which is in the opposite direction.

TIM
Of course it is.

MARY
Okay - stop the car.

TIM
Is it coming? (THE BABY...)

MARY
No, it's not coming. I just want to
point out you just had one job,
that's ONE. The keeping fit, I did -
the preparing the nursery, I did -
the packing the bag, I did - the
carrying the alien in my sodding
stomach for nine years, I did. Your
ONE AND ONLY job after impregnation
was driving me to the hospital. Do
you actually know which hospital
we're going to?

TIM
Yes.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
75.

MARY
Which hospital?

TIM
Ahm...

MARY

YOU TELL ME THE NAME OF THE
HOSPITAL OR I WILL GIVE BIRTH TO
THE BABY IN YOUR FACE.

PAUSE.

TIM
Either St. Mark something or
Paddington something?

MARY
(WITH THE VOICE OF SATAN) DRIVE! I
WILL GUIDE YOU.

CUT ON - THEY ARE STUCK IN A LONG ROW OF TRAFFIC.

MARY (CONT'D)
For God's sake - do something.
There's a head appearing between my
legs.

TIM LEAPS OUT OF THE CAR. AND GOES ROUND THE CORNER - TO SEE
A HUGE TRAFFIC JAM AHEAD, LEADING TO A FAMOUS ZEBRA CROSSING.

TIM
O Christ - Abbey Road.

THERE'S A QUEUE OF PEOPLE WAITING TO TAKE PHOTOS. TIM
APPROACHES NERVOUSLY. ACCOSTING STRANGERS IS NOT HIS
SPECIALITY.

TIM (CONT'D)
Could you just, you know, hurry up?

JAPANESE PERSON
Abbey Road. Beatles. John, George,
Paul... Lingo.

TIM
Yes, I know. Fast as you can.

THE JAPANESE FOURSOME MOVE ON - AND THE NEXT LOT, AMERICANS,
COME ON. AND STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD ARGUING ABOUT
WHO IS GOING TO BE WHO.

Well, I'm not doing it - I didn't
come all the way from Minnesota
just to be holding the goddamn

camera.
TIM

Look, I'll do it - okay. Jesus - be

careful.

HE NEARLY GETS RUN OVER - BUT GETS THE PHOTO DONE. HE TURNS
TO THE NEXT LOT, SOME GRUMPY NORTHERN TEENS.

TIM (CONT'D)
Right. The thing is, though, that
my wife is having a baby...

NORTHERNER 2
It's not going to be any bloody
good anyway, Dave, with only three
of us - it's going to look stupid.

WITH AN EAST EUROPEAN TAKING THE PICTURE.

NORTHERNER
You've got to take your shoes
off...

TIM

NORTHERNER
Paul wasn't wearing any shoes.

TIM KNEELS TO TAKE OFF HIS SHOES. THEY'RE NOW READY TO POSE.

TIM SPEEDS PAST RECEPTION - OPENS THE FIRST DOOR IN THE
CORRIDOR. A HUGE STUDIO, WHERE ADELE IS PERFORMING.

TIM
Sorry. My mistake.

HE COMES BACK OUT - OPENS THE NEXT DOOR - IT IS A BROOM
CUPBOARD.

TIM (CONT'D)
That's better.

INT. MARY'S FLAT. DAY. 73
AN HOUR EARLIER - MARY IS SITTING, VERY PREGNANT ONCE MORE.

MARY
Oh Jesus. I think it's coming.

WE CUT TO TIM - BUT NOW HE IS SURROUNDED BY MAPS OF LONDON.

TIM
Cool - I've finalised the route.
The car is outside on a special
parking metre. St. Mary's
Paddington, here we come... And I
think we should avoid Abbey Road.

and the fear.

MOTHER
O she's lovely. You were such an
ugly baby. I remember the first
time I looked at you, I thanked God
we were in driving distance of
London Zoo.

DAD
Come on, he wasn't that bad.

MOTHER
O don't be silly... But look, the
past is the past, the nightmare is
over, he grew up human, the days of
suckling a simian are a distant
nasty memory. Uncle D, do you want
a hold?

UNCLE D
O yes please...

TIM
(NERVOUS) Ahm, do you think
that's...? Yes, sure. Sure...

HE WATCHES UNCLE D WITH HIS BABY WITH PRIDE. HE GLANCES AT
HIS DAD, WHO IS LOOKING AT HIM, HIS BABY SON, NOW GROWN UP.
INT. MARY'S FLAT. DAY. 75
TIM (V.O.)
There are other things, of course -
no one can prepare you for the bad
nappies...

MARY AND TIM IN THE LIVING ROOM. THEY HEAR THE BABY CRY...

TIM
Let me do it, darling.

TIM WITH THE BABY AT A CHANGING TABLE - HE OPENS THE NAPPY -
REELS BACK IN SHOCK...

CUT STRAIGHT BACK TO THE LIVING ROOM A BIT EARLIER. THE BABY
STARTS TO CRY AGAIN...

O MY GOD. Where did this all come
from?

No one can prepare you for the love
people you love can feel for
them...

KIT KAT IS ON THE FLOOR WITH THE BABY, NOW SIX MONTHS OLD.
JUST PLAYING WITH HER - AS THOUGH THEY WERE THE SAME AGE.
MARY AND TIM OBVIOUSLY READY TO GO OUT TO DINNER.

TIM
Are you sure you're okay?

KIT KAT
I would like to babysit for her
every single day of her life. I
want you to die at the restaurant
so I can take over forever.

indifference of friends who don't
have babies...

CASUAL OF GLANCES.

JAY
Yeah, great, very pretty. Anyway -
she's 18 years old, 18. I swear,
she does not even OWN a bra... I've
never seen her indoors in trousers.
Just legs up to there and tiny,
tiny pants...

TIM (V.O.)
And nothing can prepare you for how
small a place that seemed a good
size suddenly becomes...

Bizarrely early as ever.

TIM IS OPENING THE DOOR - IT IS THE THREE OF THEM FROM HOME.

TIM
Hello, Mum, Dad. Uncle D. Wonderful
to see you. Come on in. And look,
if it isn't Godfather Rory...

RORY IS CARRYING THE LARGEST TEDDY BEAR IN HISTORY.

EVERYONE IS GATHERED - A FEW FRIENDS - A FEW BABIES - THE
FAMILY GROUP IN THEIR COMFY CHAIRS. THE GIANT TEDDY BEAR NEXT
TO UNCLE D.

RORY
Only two important things for a
godfather, I reckon - tell the
child never to eat anything bigger
than its head. And never bring a
present smaller than the child.

HARRY
O shut up.

HARRY IS THERE TOO, WITH A VERY SMALL BEAR.

MUM
I didn't expect to see you here,
Harry. Children's parties not
exactly your style.

HARRY
I was tricked. I was told there'd
be free booze. Hate kids, as you
know. For fuck's sake, Tim - I'm
going to need straight vodka if
there's a fucking clown coming.

TIM
We thought of having a clown but
decided against it - best keep
first birthdays small, just family,
two friends, one giant stuffed toy.

DAD
Speaking of which, where is Kit
Kat?

MARY

Don’t know. She said she'd be here
around three.

THE DOOR BELL GOES.

TIM
Speak of the devil...

Jimmy - what can I do for you? And
where's my sister?

JIMMY
I thought she was here.

TIM
No - she never arrived.

JIMMY
That's not good.

TIM

There's a song by Baz Luhrmann,
called Sunscreen - and I've never
forgotten two lines from it -
“Worrying about the future is as
effective as trying to solve an

bubblegum. The real troubles in
your life will always be things
that never crossed your worried
mind.”

BADLY CUT AND BRUISED. HER HAIR PULLED BACK TIGHTLY.

TIM
What happened?

WE SEE A FLASH BACK TO A HUGE CAR CRASH - SMASHING GLASS AND
VIOLENCE. THE CAR, A PURPLE MINI, CLEARLY BELONGS TO KIT KAT.

KIT KAT
We had a fight. And maybe I wasn't
completely sober.

TIM
It was tea time. On a weekday.

KIT KAT

TIM
I blame Jimmy.

KIT KAT
It’s so not his fault.

That's a broom cupboard.

TIM

MARY
You cut it fine.

TIM
Sorry - I had to pick up Kit Kat.

HE HEADS IN WITH KIT KAT FOLLOWING - ALTHOUGH NOW WELL, OF
COURSE, SHE IS NOT LOOKING HER BEST. SHE SLINKS IN, HAS BAGS
UNDER HER EYES. THERE'S STILL SOME OF THE USUAL NATURAL
SPARKLE, BUT A SENSE OF SOMETHING WRONG UNDERNEATH. KIT KAT
APPROACHES THE FAMILY GROUP...

MARY (WHISPERING TO TIM)
She couldn't come herself?

TIM
No, as it turns out, she couldn't.

CUT BACK TO THEM AFTER THE PARTY. RELAXING IN THE CHAOS....

TIM (CONT'D)
I'm worried about Kit Kat.

MARY
I know. She was drinking vodka
while we were drinking tea. And
Jimmy wasn't nice to her.

TIM
We have to do fix it.

We can’t do that. If it’s going to

How do I immediately know I'm about
to be ticked off?

TIM
You're not. But I AM a little
worried...

KIT KAT

What did I tell you? It's a full-
blooded ticking off.

TIM
It's just, you know, this is a
strange place for you still to be
coming all the time. Here with Mum
and Dad and Uncle D...

KIT KAT
My best friend.

TIM
Indeed. But, what's happened?
You're the best person in the
world. Top equal with my wife. And
the dog in The Artist. I don't
quite get it.

KIT KAT
Neither do I.

KIT KAT (CONT'D)
I thought life was going to be so
great. But somehow up in London, in

TIM

We are making sure you do NOT meet

SIDLES KIT KAT INTO THE NEXT ROOM. HE DOES LOOKS COOL.

KIT KAT
But we have sex later.

TIM
Not this time you don’t.

JOHN
Thanks Kittle - I have no intention
of going to Thailand.

KIT KAT
No, but you do - seriously. And
there are pictures of you all over

and put his hand down the back of
my jeans.

TIM
Come on.

THEY RETREAT INTO THE NEXT ROOM - JIMMY FOLLOWS - THEY WATCH
HIM FROM THE CORNER LIKE HAWKS. HE GLIDES THROUGH THE ROOM.
HELPS HIMSELF TO A DRINK. STANDS VERY STILL, SURVEYS THE ROOM
- TIM AND KIT KAT HAVE TO TURN AROUND QUICKLY TO AVOID HIS
GAZE. THEY THEN TURN BACK. JIMMY HAS SPOTTED HIS PREY. HE
HEADS TOWARDS A VERY PRETTY GIRL. SUDDENLY HE TURNS ON ALL
HIS CHARM. KIT KAT FROWNS. TIM WATCHES HER. THEN LOOKS BACK
AT JIMMY. ALREADY HE IS LEANING A LITTLE TOO CLOSE THE GIRL,
WHO IS SO FLATTERED BY HIS ATTENTIONS. HE WHISPERS SOMETHING
TO HER, AND HIS HAND SLIPS BEHIND HER BACK, MOVES DOWN
TOWARDS THE BACK OF HER JEANS.

KIT KAT
Right. I get it.

AND SHE MARCHES STRAIGHT OVER TO HIM.

KIT KAT (CONT'D)
Excuse me, Jimmy.

JIMMY
Do we know each other?

KIT KAT
Yes, we do. Very well. And this is
what I should have done right at

hoping is that from this moment on
you avoid the sleazy bad guys -
because they’re sleazy and bad. So
you don’t spend your life feeling
worthless, giving up every job on
some bastard's whim, living in
horrible flats waiting for the

DAD
Think about that thing I mentioned.
Practice.

TIM

I will. Thank you.

DAD
Mary.

SHE HUGS HIM - HE WHISPERS.
DAD (CONT'D)
I've left everything to you. Don’t
give him a penny.
MARY

Thanks. The moment you die, I’m
leaving him.

104 INT. TRAIN. DAY. 104

TIM IS ON THE TRAIN THINKING ABOUT WHAT HIS FATHER SAID. WE
ARE INTERESTED. WHAT WAS THE SECRET?

MARY
What did you two talk about all
that time?

TIM
Stuff. And you and Mum?

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z

106.

MARY
We decided it would be best if you
never die. If you can work on
immortality that would be great.

HE LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW - WHEN HE TURNS BACK, A TEAR IS
FALLING DOWN HER CHEEK.

TIM
You’re such a wonderful woman. I’m
so lucky to have you.

INT. TIM AND MARY'S HOUSE. DAY. 105
BACK HOME IN BED...

MARY
What's your day tomorrow?

TIM
Ghastly. Long, boring meeting. Very
difficult case - very late night.

INT/EXT. LONDON. DAY. 106

DISTINCTIVE MUSIC PLAYS. FIRST, WE SEE TIM IN THE MIDDLE OF A
LONG LEGAL MEETING - WE SEE THEM ALL TALKING AND RORY IS
THERE - BUT WE ONLY NOTICE THE BORING DISCUSSION...

THEN TIM RUSHES LUNCH... BUYS A SANDWICH FROM 'PRET A
MANGER’.

HE GETS A PHONE CALL FROM KIT KAT AS HE AND RORY WALK TOWARDS
THE COURT. HE IS IMPATIENT HEARING FROM HER, TRYING TO GET
OFF THE CALL FROM THE VERY START...

TIM
Hey Kit Kat. How's things? O Good -
great. Look, I'm sorry, this isn't
a great time. Maybe later. Okay.
Okay. Well look, that's great - I'm
really pleased. Wow. Great. Good
old Teddy. Urgh. Honey - this is so
not the right time - I'm needed in
court in about five minutes. Okay.
Yes. I'm going to have to go or
I'll lose my job. Let's talk later.
Okay. Okay.

THEN INTO COURT. HE IS SUMMING UP TO THE JURY. HIS CLIENT IS
VERY WORRIED AND HE IS VERY TENSE - BUT HE GETS THE RESULT
THAT HE WANTED - ‘NOT GUILTY’ - AND, AS HE TIDIES HIS PAPERS,
HE SAYS TO HIMSELF “PHEW”.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
107

107.

COMING BACK HOME ON THE UNDERGROUND - BORED. CHECKING HIS
WATCH. TIRED. AN ANNOYING MAN ON THE TRAIN LISTENING TO HIS
TOO LOUD IPOD.

GETTING HOME LATE. HEADING OFF TO BED ASAP, AFTER THIS LITTLE
BIT OF EXHAUSTED DIALOGUE IN THE KITCHEN.

MARY
How was it?

TIM
Tough. Dull. Tense. Time for bed.

CUT TO THEM IN BED.

MARY
Light off?

TIM
Yes - though I might just pop to
the bathroom first...

CUT TO TIM IN THE BATHROOM.

TIM (CONT'D)
Okay, Dad, let’s give it a go.

HE SHUTS HIS FISTS AND TRAVELS.

INT/EXT. LONDON. DAY. 107
CUT STRAIGHT BACK TO THE START OF THE SAME DAY.

THE SAME LONG MEETING - WE SEE THEM ALL TALKING - BUT THIS
TIME WE SEE TIM LOOK ACROSS AT RORY WHO WE JUST GLIMPSED IN
THE BACKGROUND EARLIER - AND HE SMILES AT HIM - AND RORY
BEAMS BACK. RORY MIMES A LITTLE SECRET YAWN. THEN TIM GOES
BACK TO LISTENING... AND WHEN THE OTHER LAWYER SAYS SOMETHING
CLEVER SAYS “THAT IS A VERY GOOD POINT”.

THEN TIM RUSHES LUNCH... BUT THIS TIME, HE ENJOYS SCANNING
THE FOOD AND PICKS OUT SOMETHING NICE - AND THEN THERE'S A
PRETTY GIRL WHO SERVES HIM IN THE SAME WAY AS BEFORE, BUT HE
RESPONDS POSITIVELY AND CIVILLY TO HER.

HE GETS THE PHONE CALL FROM KIT KAT AS HE AND RORY ARE IN THE
CORRIDOR LEADING TO THE COURT.

TIM
Give me a second.

RORY
We are really late.

TIM
Just...

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
108.

AND HE STOPS AND TAKES THE CALL.

TIM (CONT'D)

Hey Kit Kat. How's everything?
You're kidding! You’re kidding! O
Christ - I’m so sorry I’m in a tiny
bit of a rush...

RORY IS LITERALLY JUMPING UP AND DOWN WITH NERVES - THE
CORRIDORS ARE GETTING EMPTY - EVERYONE IS SUDDENLY AT WORK...

- but that is so great. Good old
Teddy. Say ‘yes’ - even if you’re
not sure - say ‘yes’. And yes - we
are absolutely free on Thursday.
I'm actually needed in court ten
minutes ago, so can’t tie down ALL
the details. But yes, my darling, I
love you and this is great news.
And I‘'1l ring you back a little bit
later when I’m not about to give a
close personal friend a heart
attack. Bye, sweetie, bye.

AND THEN HIM AND RORY SPRINT FASTER THAN USAIN BOLT ALONG THE
ANCIENT CORRIDOR IN THE DIRECTION OF THE COURTROOM.

CUT INTO THE COURT. THIS TIME THOUGH, INSTEAD OF THE MYOPIC
RUSHED VIEW - TIM SEES THE BEAUTY OF THE BRITISH COURTROOM,
GRAND, BEAUTIFUL, LEATHER, CIVILIZED, ORGANISED.

CUT TO HIS SUMMARY - “LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY” — AND
HE LOOKS INTO THEIR EYES TO SEE THEM AS REAL PEOPLE, REALLY
LISTENING, TAKING THEIR JOB SERIOUSLY. AND HE LOOKS BACK AT
HIS CLIENT - REALLY CARING. HE CAN FEEL THE POWER OF WHAT
HE'S SAYING - SAYS IT WITH A LITTLE MORE RELISH.

AND THEN CUT TO THE VERDICT. AND WHEN THE JUROR SAYS 'NOT
GUILTY' - TIM IS UNCOOL - A HUGE SMILE - A WARM HANDSHAKE
WITH THE OVERJOYED CLIENT - A LOOK AT THE JURORS AND HOW
PROUD THEY ARE OF THEIR CORRECT DECISION. HIS EARLIER “PHEW” —
NO CELEBRATION, JUST RELIEF - IS REPLACED BY “HURRAY”.

COMING BACK HOME ON THE UNDERGROUND - LOOKING AT HIS WATCH.
ACCEPTING IT'S LATE - UNBUTTONING HIS JACKET, LOUNGING BACK.
ACTUALLY HEARING THE MUSIC COMING FROM THE MAN'S IPOD - AND
ENJOYING IT.

CUT TO MARY AND TIM IN BED AGAIN.

MARY
So, not as bad a day as expected?

TIM

No, pretty good actually. Very good
day really.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
108

109

109.

MARY
That’s a relief. If it’d been a bad
day, I thought I might have had to
have sex with you to make up for
it.

TIM
It was a very bad day. It went very
badly. I lost my job. I killed a
man. And I think I just heard one
of our children die downstairs.

HE GIVES HER A BIG SMILE. IT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME DAY - AND
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

TIM (V.O.)
And so I began to live the new life
my Dad gave me. Each day, lived
twice. Once with all the strains
and tensions that stop us noticing
how sweet the world can be - and
once, well, noticing.

INT. TRAIN. DAY. 108

MARY AND TIM ARE BACK ON THE TRAIN GOING NORTH... MUSIC
PLAYS.

TIM (V.O.)
Some days, of course, though, you
only want once...

INT. FAMILY HOME. DAY. 109

THE EMPTY HALLWAY AT HOME. THEN UNCLE D COMES DOWNSTAIRS,
FIXING HIS WAISTCOAT, BLACK SUIT. THEN KIT KAT, BLACK JEANS
AND T-SHIRT, NO SHOES. WITH HER NICE BOYFRIEND TEDDY. THEN
MARY IN A PRETTY BLACK DRESS. THEN TIM IN HIS SUIT, NOW
JOINED BY HIS MUM.

MUM
Right - are we ready for this?

HARRY COMES IN FROM THE NEXT ROOM, AND WALKS THROUGH.

HARRY
Course we’re not. Hateful day.

TIM
Just give me one minute.

HE GOES INTO THE TOILET - HE COMES OUT DRESSED IN NORMAL

CLOTHES. HE HEADS INTO THE STUDY. HIS DAD IN PERFECT HEALTH
IS SITTING IN HIS BIG LEATHER CHAIR, READING DICKENS...

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
110.

DAD
This bit's very good - can I just
read you this bit -

TIM
Read away. We've got all the time
in the world.
PAUSE - THERE'S SOMETHING ODD IN THE AIR AS TIM SITS.

DAD
Where have you come from?

THERE ARE TEARS IN TIM'S EYES.
DAD (CONT'D)
Okay - okay. Thanks for coming.
How's Uncle D's suit?

TIM
Immaculate.

DAD
Excellent. Mary’s dress?

TIM
Quite sexy actually.

DAD
Perfect. Did I mention I wanted
that Stevie Wonder track?

TIM
Yes - all set.

DAD
Excellent.

AND HE BEGINS TO READ A FUNNY PASSAGE FROM 'DOMBEY AND SON'
OUT LOUD, AS TIM SITS AND LISTENS.

110 EXT. FAMILY HOME. DAY. 110
OUTSIDE THE BIG CAR IS DRIVING AWAY, WITH ALL OF THEM IN IT.

ll INT. TRAIN. DAY. 111
BACK IN LONDON, TIM AND MARY ARE ON THE TRAIN HOME. HE LOOKS
UP, THOUGHTFULLY. SHE IS LOOKING AT HIM. THE KIDS ARE WITH
THEM, ASLEEP...

TIM
Tough.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
112

111.

MARY
Tough. Though I thought Jenny
Arbuthnot looked cute in black.

TIM
True. She knows how to excite a
man.
INT. TIM AND MARY’S HOUSE. NIGHT. 112

THEY ARE LAYING THE KIDS DOWN AT NIGHT, CARRYING THEM IN FROM

THE TRAIN,

LAYING THEM INTO BED. THEY CREEP BACK INTO THE

CORRIDOR. LEAN AGAINST THE WALL - END OF A LONG DAY....

MARY
What do you think about the kids?

TIM
What about them?

MARY
Not very many, are there?

TIM
I'm sorry?

CUT - THEY ARE SITTING ON CHAIRS IN THE RAMSHACKLE GARDEN,
BOTH DRINKING...

PAUSE. WE

A SHOT OF

MARY
I just thought. Maybe - you know -
it's time for the insurance baby.
In case one of them is really
clever - we don't want the other
one to spend their whole life
feeling stupid - if we have another
one, at least we could have two
happy thickies.

TIM
You're so romantic.

MARY
What do you think?

KNOW IT’S A HUGE DECISION FOR HIM.

TIM
Cool. Cool. Dad always wished there
had been more of us... And anyway -

we might try and nothing happens.

MARY
Exactly.

THE OLD FAMILY HOME. A SHOT OF THE NEW HOUSE. TIME

IS PASSING BY.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z

INT. TIM AND MARY'S HOUSE. DAY. 113
MARY IS VERY PREGNANT FOR THE THIRD TIME - IN THEIR BEDROOM.

MARY
Could be tonight.

TIM
And you cannot believe the detail
in which I know the route to the
hospital. Will you excuse me for a
sec - there's something I've got to
finish.

HE IS HEADING DOWNSTAIRS. GOES INTO THE LIVING ROOM, IN TOTAL
DARKNESS. STANDS THERE BOLDLY, FISTS CLENCHED.

EXT/INT. FAMILY HOME. DAY. 114
CUT TO OUTSIDE THE FAMILY HOME.

INSIDE TIM AND HIS DAD ARE PLAYING TABLE TENNIS. HIS DAD WINS
ONE FINAL LAST DRAMATIC POINT WITH A FLOURISH AND A SMASH.

DAD
O my God. I won. I haven't won for
years!

TIM

You finally got good.
DAD
What's my prize? Apart from the
Olympic gold medal, of course?
PAUSE. A BIG SMILE FROM TIM.

TIM
A kiss will have to do.

DAD
A kiss? A kiss?
TIM STEPS FORWARD AND KISSES HIS FATHER GENTLY ON THE CHEEK.
THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER. SUDDENLY IT IS CLEAR TO HIS DAD.
THIS IS THE LAST TIME.

DAD (CONT'D)
I get you. This is it then?

TIM
Yes. This is it.

DAD
My son.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z

113.

TIM
My Dad.

THEY BOTH SMILE. PAUSE.

DAD
Or just one more game - I'd love to
beat you twice.

TIM
It's never going to happen.

DAD
“Who'd have thought it - father and
son for the 28th year in the
Olympic final - and young Tim
suddenly looking like a broken
man.”

EXT/INT. FAMILY HOME. WINTER. 115

CUT OUTSIDE THE FAMILY HOUSE AGAIN - BUT NOW IT'S WINTER -—
SPECKS ON SNOW.

TIM (V.O.)
So now I'm almost up to date with
my story. Sometimes, just for fun -
I still bounce around -

CUT INSIDE, WHERE CHRISTMAS IS BEING CELEBRATED AROUND THE
TREE. TEDDY THE BOYFRIEND IS HOLDING A NEW IPAD.

TIM
Mum - surprisingly modern and good
taste gift for you.

MUM
Thank you. Open yours - it's even
better.

HE OPENS IT - THE MOST HIDEOUS HAT OF ALL TIME. THE FULL
KNITTED SANTA.

MUM (CONT'D)
What do you think?

TIM
I think it's GORGEOUS.

WE CUT TO HIS MUM, DELIGHTED, THEN CUT BACK TO TIM - HE IS
NOW HOLDING THE IPAD, NOT THE HAT.

Have you got one of these, Ted?

TEDDY IS WEARING THE HIDEOUS HAT.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z

114.

TEDDY
No - I'd love one, but who really
needs it, when you’ve got this hat?

EXT/INT. TIM AND MARY'S HOUSE. DAY. 116
THE OUTSIDE OF THE LONDON HOUSE.

TIM (V.O.)
But in the end, I think I've at
last learnt the full message from
my strange adventures in time - the
truth is I now don't travel back at
all, not even for the day. I just
live every day as if I I’ve
deliberately come back to this one
day - to enjoy it as if it was the
full, final day of my lucky life...

IN THE BEDROOM. BOTH OF THEM IN BED. A GLOWING GREY DAY
OUTSIDE.

MARY
I'll do the kids.

TIM
No, don't worry - I'll do them.

MARY
Yes, you do them, lazy bastard.

SHE TURNS AND GOES BACK TO SLEEP. HE LOOKS AT HER AND LOVES
HER.

THE DEFINITIVE MUSIC OF THE FILM PLAYS. SUDDENLY, THE CAMERA
STYLE CHANGES SUBTLY - A SPECIAL BEAUTY IN EVERYTHING...

TIM HEADS DOWNSTAIRS - POSY'S WAITING, IN HER LITTLE PINK
SCHOOL UNIFORM - TIM STARTS TO MAKE BREAKFAST - THE LITTLE
BOY DRIFTS IN, ALL SLEEPY AND PYJAMA'D.

CUT TO TIM FLIPPING A PANCAKE UTTERLY BADLY.

POSY
You are the WORST.
LITTLE BOY
Want Mummy...

TIM LAUGHS AT HIS NAUGHTY SON.

INT/EXT. LONDON STREETS/BUS/LEGAL CHAMBERS. DAY. 117
HE WALKS POSY TO SCHOOL - WAVES TO HER OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL

GATES. WALKS AWAY - LOOKS AT THE STREETS HE WALKS EVERY DAY,
WITH THEIR PRIVATE CHARM.

RC ABOUT TIME - MARCH 8 2U1Z
115.

HE RUNS AND CATCHES A BUS - A YOUNG GIRL AND AN OLD WOMAN
SITTING IN FRONT OF HIM CHAT ENTHUSIASTICALLY.

AT WORK RORY IS THERE - LOOKING CHAOTIC - WORKING HARD - INK
ON HIS FINGERS...

RORY
Hell of a day ahead.

TIM
We'll get through it.

A MORNING CUP OF TEA... IT'S JUST THE MOST UTTERLY NORMAL
DAY. BUT EVERYTHING IS FULL OF ORDINARY SPECIAL BEAUTY.

AND THEN CUT TO TIM AND RORY IN UTTER CHAOS RUSHING ALONG A
CORRIDOR, LATE AGAIN —- WHEN HIS MOBILE GOES. IT IS MARY.

INTERCUT WITH HER. SHE IS ALSO IN A RUSH, SOMEWHERE ELSE IN
LONDON, LOOKING WONDERFUL, THE WIND BLOWING HER HAIR.

MARY
What time are you home tonight?

TIM
About 9, I hope. You?

MARY
6. What do you fancy for dinner, my
hungry husband?

TIM
You decide.

MARY
Risotto?

TIM

What flavour?

MARY
Maybe chicken.

TIM
Chicken would be absolute heaven.

HE HANGS UP, STEPS FORWARD. FREEZE.

AND THAT IS THAT - THE REALITY OF DINNER WITH SOMEONE YOU
LOVE AT THE END OF A NORMAL WORKING DAY IS ACTUALLY WHAT
HEAVEN IS.
