Whether it's for flood forecasting, disaster management and early-warning systems, in agriculture, in health. It's across the board."Displays showed off prosthetic limbs that could learn from a user's behaviour and adapt to muscle activity, devices to help visually impaired people avoid obstacles in the street and bionic cats and dogs built to act as companions.The football-playing robots were the work of a group of students from the university of ETH Zurich.The team kicked, passed and kept track of the ball based on input from sensors."The project allows our undergraduate and graduate students to collect experience on a full robotic platform," Jan-Nico Zaech, the project's scientific supervisor, said."It's a platform to test algorithms that can run in the real world afterwards."The Technology Roundup newsletter brings the latest news and trends straight to your inbox.
